For an example of this in action see GTMCarbonEventTest.m.\n\n- Added GTMFileSystemKQueue.  It provides a simple wrapper for kqueuing something in the file system and tracking changes to it.\n\n- RunIPhoneUnitTest.sh now cleans up the user home directory and creates a documents directory within it, used when requesting a NSDocumentDirectory.\n\n- Added GTMNSFileManager+Carbon which contains routines for path <-> Alias conversion and path <-> FSRef conversion.\n\n- Added GTMNSArray+Merge for merging one array into another with or without a custom merging function, returning a new array with the merged contents."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- fix up some style things.\n- change the api slightly so things are a little more \"cocoa-y\"."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"Fixing the use of the wrong var w/ the failure selector.\n  (http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/issues/detail?id=10)"},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- Added GTMLightweightProxy\n- Added installer for the spotlight importers."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- Added has ability to check if a script has an open handler to GTMNSAppleScript+Handler.\n- GTMStackTrace support for building a trace from the call stack in an NSException (for 10.5+ and iPhone).\n- Added GTMUIFont+LineHeight.\n- Cleaned up some OS version checks to use constants instead of numbers directly."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- Update iphone address book radars.\n- Fix for issue 7 GTMABMutableMultiValue instantiation returns nil."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- GTM_INLINE will make sure a function gets inlined, and provides a consistent\n  way for all GTM code to do it.\n\n- Added GTMDebugThreadValidation to allow you to enforce the fact that your\n  code must run in the main thread in DEBUG builds.\n\n- Updated some internals of the iPhone unittesting so it doesn't double print\n  the test descriptions, file names, or lines numbers of a test failure line.\n  Also includes the test names in the error output.\n\n- Changed the xcconfigs so that know it's easier to set different settings at\n  the different levels and not accidentally overwrite settings set at lower\n  levels in the \"settings collapse\". Also tightened up warnings significantly.\n\n- Changed how gtm_unitTestExposedBindingsTestValues works. If you have an\n  implementation of gtm_unitTestExposedBindingsTestValues in your own code\n  you will need to update to the new way of calling. See implementations in\n  GTMNSObject+BindingUnitTesting.m for details.\n\n- Added support for grabbing the build number for a particular OS in\n  GTMSystemVersion and easily comparing it to known build numbers, and switched \n  some types from in GTMSystemVersion from \"int\" to SInt32 to make 64 bit work \n  better.\n   \n- Added support for SnowLeopard (10A96). We build cleanly with the 10.6 SDKs and\n  all radar checks were updated accordingly. Build All script was also updated\n  to build on SnowLeopard if you have the SDK available.\n  \n- Turned off building ppc64 GTM because the SnowLeopard SDK currently\n  doesn't have ppc64 support, so SenTestCase isn't defined. This makes it\n  impossible to build the ppc64 10.5 config on SnowLeopard. We have left the\n  setting in the xcconfig for those of you who need it, but have disabled\n  it in the GTM project settings.\n  \n- Turned on stack smashing protection on the debug builds for all Leopard \n  and above.\n\n- Added ability to easily do leak checking by defining the GTM_ENABLE_LEAKS\n  environment variable. It isn't on by default because several of Apple's\n  frameworks leak. You can work around these false positives by using the\n  GTM_LEAKS_SYMBOLS_TO_IGNORE environment variable. Also if you turn on leaks\n  make sure to turn off zombies by defining the GTM_DISABLE_ZOMBIES variable,\n  otherwise every memory allocation you do will look like a leak."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"fix double printing of failures on the iphone unittests"},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"added missing comment in release notes (forgot to hit safe).\nremove the reference from the GTM project to the iPhone one (doesn't work and\n  the script target works instead)."},"author_login":"thomasvl","committer_login":"thomasvl"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Thomas Van Lenten","email":"thomasvl@gmail.com"},"message":"- Added GTMTestTimer.h for doing high fidelity timings.\n \n- Added leaks checking to iPhone unit test script.
