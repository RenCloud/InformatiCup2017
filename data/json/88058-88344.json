standardize a postal address using the Google Geocoding API or MelissaData","readme":"# address_standardization\n\n## What is it?\n\nDespite the long name, this is a tiny Ruby library to quickly standardize a\npostal address, either via the Google Geocoding API or MelissaData. So if you\nhave an online store and you need to verify a shipping address, then you might\nconsider using this library.\n\n## What is it *not*?\n\nThis is not a library to *geocode* addresses or locations. In other words, you\nwon't get world coordinates back for a location. If you need this information,\nthen there are other libraries that will do this for you, such as\n[graticule](http://github.com/collectiveidea/graticule) or\n[GeoKit](https://github.com/imajes/geokit).\n\n## How do I install it?\n\n    gem install address_standardization\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nRight now this library supports two services: the Google Geocoding API and\nMelissaData. All services work the same way: you call a `standardize_address`\nmethod with a hash of address data. If the address exists (according to the\nservice), you'll get back a full hash of address data. Otherwise, you'll get\nback `nil`.\n\nBoth Google and MelissaData have benefits and drawbacks. First, in terms of\npostal addresses there are three kinds of addresses you are probably concerned\nwith: US addresses, Canadian addresses, and then international addresses.\n\n### Google\n\nGoogle is pretty great in that in knows about all sorts of addresses. So if\nyou're trying to verify an address in France, then Google probably knows about\nit. However, it is not very useful in terms of standardizing US addresses,\nbecause it doesn't know what to do with P.O. boxes.\n\nThat said, here is how you'd standardize a US address:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::GoogleMaps.standardize_address(\n      :street => \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\",\n      :city => \"Mountain View\",\n      :state => \"CA\"\n    )\n    addr.street      #=> \"1600 AMPHITHEATRE PKWY\"\n    addr.city        #=> \"MOUNTAIN VIEW\"\n    addr.county      #=> \"SANTA CLARA\"\n    addr.state       #=> \"CA\"\n    addr.zip         #=> \"94043\"\n    addr.country     #=> \"UNITED STATES\"\n\nBy default, the `standardize_address` method will leave it up to the service to\ndecide which country to scope the address query to. Google may be able to figure\nit out based on the address you provide, but you can always narrow it down by\nproviding a `:country` key. So for instance, to standardize a Canadian address:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::GoogleMaps.standardize_address(\n      :street => \"55 East Cordova St. Apt 415\",\n      :city => \"Vancouver\",\n      :province => \"BC\",\n      :country => \"Canada\"\n    )\n    addr.street       #=> \"55 E CORDOVA ST\"\n    addr.city         #=> \"VANCOUVER\"\n    addr.district     #=> \"GREATER VANCOUVER REGIONAL DISTRICT\"\n    addr.province     #=> \"ON\"\n    addr.postal_code  #=> \"V6A 1K3\"\n    addr.country      #=> \"CANADA\"\n\nNote that `province` is an alias for `state`, `district` is an alias for\n`county` and `postal_code` is an alias for `zip`.\n\nAnd to standardize a French address:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::GoogleMaps.standardize_address(\n      :street => \"Parvis de Notre Dame\",\n      :city => \"Paris\",\n      :country => \"France\"\n    )\n    addr.street       #=> \"PLACE DU PARVIS NOTRE-DAME\"\n    addr.city         #=> \"PARIS\"\n    addr.region       #=> \"ÃŽLE-DE-FRANCE\"\n    addr.postal_code  #=> \"75004\"\n    addr.country      #=> \"FRANCE\"\n\nFinally, note what happens if we attempt to standardize a bogus address:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::GoogleMaps.standardize_address(\n      :street => \"abcdef\"\n    )\n    addr  #=> nil\n\n### MelissaData\n\nIf you want to simply verify US addresses, then MelissaData is a better bet, as\nit not only understands P.O. boxes, but it is also able to tell whether a unit\nor apartment number is left out of the address (although currently this\ninformation is not used; there is an\n[open ticket](https://github.com/mcmire/address_standardization/issues/12) to\ndo this).\n\nStandardizing a US address works much the same way as with Google:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::MelissaData.standardize_address(\n      :street => \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\",\n      :city => \"Mountain View\",\n      :state => \"CA\"\n    )\n    addr.street      #=> \"1600 AMPHITHEATRE PKWY\"\n    addr.city        #=> \"MOUNTAIN VIEW\"\n    addr.county      #=> \"SANTA CLARA\"\n    addr.state       #=> \"CA\"\n    addr.zip         #=> \"94043-1351\"\n    addr.country     #=> \"UNITED STATES\"\n\nAs mentioned, you can also do P.O. boxes:\n\n    addr = AddressStandardization::MelissaData.standardize_address(\n      :street => 'P.O. Box 400160',\n      :city => 'Charlottesville',\n      :state => 'VA'\n    )\n    addr.street      #=> \"PO BOX 400160\"\n    addr.city        #=> \"CHARLOTTESVILLE\"\n    addr.county      #=> \"ALBEMARLE\"\n    addr.state       #=> \"VA\"\n    addr.zip         #=> \"22904-4160\"\n    addr.country     #=> \"UNITED STATES\"\n\n## How do I hack on it?\n\n* Run `bundle install` to ensure you have all dependencies.\n* Add your changes.\n* Write some tests! Tests are written in RSpec, so `rspec FILE` to run a\n  single test, and `rake test` to run all of the tests.\n* Want me to merge your changes? Fork the project and submit a pull\n  request. I'll take a look at it when I can.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* Evan Whalen ([evanwhalen](http://github.com/evanwhalen))\n* Ryan Heneise ([mysmallidea](http://github.com/mysmallidea))\n\n## Support\n\nIf you need help, you can get in touch with me here:\n\n  * **Twitter**: [@mcmire](http://twitter.com/mcmire)\n  * **Email**: <elliot.winkler@gmail.com>\n\n## Copyright/License\n\n(c) 2008-2011 Elliot Winkler.

Please check the README... I want someone to take this project further, I'm struggling with making the time for it, ironically enough.","readme":"So this is Timelets, aimed at short interval task management for invoicing.\n\nI developed this for a previous employer, the target users were linux system \nadmins, who had many tasks to keep track of during any given day.  The company \nhas since disbanded for a number of reasons, and the owner has kindly allowed me \nto release the codebase.  It is by no means complete, I was hoping someone would \nwant to take up the batton and help me finish it.  It's not very configurable at\npresent (ito of logos etc), but there isn't too much to conifgure yet, so that\nshouldn't be too hard to add.\n\nAs it stands it's functional from the input side... users can log efforts in a \nnumber of ways, review their efforts historically, and an operations manager can \nview anyone's.  The interface is ajax-heavy but nice and clean and usable.\nWhat isn't done is the billing/reporting side of things.  Generating invoices \netc.  The admin interface for user/customer/contracts management is also not \ndone yet.  We were using the app in production, doing billing from it and it was \nworking fine, we were just managing it out of console in the interim.\n\nI've left a sqlite development db so that anyone can just grab the code and pull \nthe app up immediately. I'm hoping that when you've seen it you'll drop \neverything you're doing right now and take this project further.  \nThere are 2 users, a normal user (login: 'user'; password: 'test'), and an \noperations manager user (login: 'manager'; password: 'test').  There's a single \nCustomer, with one of each Contract type.  No Efforts though, you'll have to \nallocate some.\n\n\nSo... if you're interested, I'll do a quick run through the model...\n\nUsers have Efforts, Efforts belong to a Contract, which is an STI superclass, \nparent to PointContract and RateContract (explained below).  Contracts belongs \nto a Customer, who has a BillingCycle.  The BillingCycle thing hasn't been taken \nvery far yet, I would consider having the Contracts belong to a BillingCycle, \nrather than the Customer.  Then there's the standard Role based authentication, \nexcept that only controllers that care about access overwrite authenticated? \nfrom restful_authentication.  This was so that I didn't have to manage rights \nfor controllers that all users will have access to.\n\nCONTRACTS:\nRate contracts have office hours and after hours rates, while point contracts \nhave a point rate, and an adjustment to be applied to time acrued after hours.  \nEach user can have a point value... so that seniors can be charged at a higher \npoint/hour rate than juniors.  Both contract types maintain the idea of a \nretainer, either of points or hours, and both share a flag indicating whether \nthe retainer includes after hours work. At the moment efforts are associated \nwith contracts, but none of the reporting/billing structure is done. If a \ncustomer only has one contract the front end will hide the selection from you, \nassuming that you're after that single contract.\n\nEFFORTS:\nEfforts can be calculated from any 2 of the 3 references of a duration:  start, \nstop and duration.  If all 3 are provided they will be checked for accuracy.  \nThe front end uses auto-complete Chronic date parsing for start and stop, and \naccepts duration in minutes.  If you allocate an effort across 2 days it will be \nsplit into 2 efforts, starting and stopping at midnight.  This helped for daily \nefforts calculation.   If a user allocates an effort that overlaps with another \neffort, it will adjust any existing efforts accordingly.  It will split efforts \ninto 2, shorten, lengthen or even remove them completely.  the user is informed \nof these changes.  The idea is to use this feedback to eventually warn of the \nchanges first and have the user confirm, and possibly even adjust the existing \nor allocated efforts.\n\nINTERFACE:\nThere is a nice timeline at the top of the page, with date selection and a daily \ntimeline where efforts appear as bars indicating duration.  They can be selected \nand the feedback area will provide details of the effort.  This timeline is \nintrinsic to all time-based work, and tends to stay on most pages.  Efforts can\nbe allocated by starting a timer (the start time can be specified in natural \nlanguage), or by explicitly allocating the effort by providing at least 2 of the \n3 references to a duration mentioned above.  These are provided from seperate \nforms, meaning efforts can be explicitly allocated while a timer is running.\nThe timed efforts are held as an incomplete Effort record, a user can only have \none incomplete effort at a time.  So if browser crashes or user logs off, the \ntimer is still \"running\".\n\nIf you have any questions, or would like a fork, please dont hesitate to contact \nme, I will be of as much help as I

Rails plugin that provides helpers to highlight code with pretty TextMate-style highlighting.","readme":"TmSyntaxHighlighting\n====================\n** NOTE: You must install ultraviolet *before* installing this plugin. Follow the instructions below.\n\nThis plugin allows you to add TextMate themed syntax highlighting to your views.\n\nIt requires the Ultraviolet gem, which requires TextPow, which requires oniguruma (both the gem and the system library).\n\nOniguruma is a regular expression library used by TextPow in order to properly parse TextMate syntax/language files.\nIt's relatively easy to install, here is the URL for the library:\n  http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/\n\nThen you need to do\n  $ gem install ultraviolet  \nwhich should install ultraviolet, textpow, and oniguruma.\n\nLastly, in order for this plugin to properly copy the syntax CSS files from ultraviolet, ultraviolet must already be installed. In other words, you need to install ultraviolet before installing this plugin.\n\nThe plugin comes with a generator for the stylesheets for the different themes.\n  \n  # to see a list of themes\n  $ script/generate syntax_css list\n  \n  # to copy all the themes to public/stylesheets/syntax\n  $ script/generate syntax_css all\n  \n  # to copy a single theme to public/stylesheets/syntax\n  $ script/generate syntax_css theme_name\n  \nExample\n=======\n\nThe plugin adds 2 view helper methods: code and syntax_css\n\ncode (helper method) usage\n==========================\n\n  code(some_ruby_code, :theme => \"twilight\", :lang => \"ruby\", :line_numbers => true)\n  \nlang and line_numbers are optional. lang will default to plain_text and line_numbers will default to true.\nIt is *HIGHLY* recommended that you fragment_cache or some other type of caching for code fragments (TextPow and/or Ultraviolet have some speed issues).\n\ntheme can be an array, and one will be chosen at random.\n\nyou can set defaults in an initializer:\n\n  # config/initializers/tm_syntax_config.rb\n  TmSyntaxHighlighting.defaults = {:theme => \"sunburst\", :line_numbers => true, :lang => \"ruby\"}\n  \nagain, theme can be an array and will be chosen at random.\n\n\nsyntax_css (helper_method) usage\n================================\nlastly, the syntax_css method will include the stylesheet tags for the themes\n\nyou can call it with a theme name\n\n  syntax_css(\"twilight\")\n  \nor if you call it with no options, it will include all the css files for the themes used in this request\n\n  code(some_ruby_code, :theme => \"twilight\")\n  code(some_more_ruby_code, :theme => \"sunburst\")\n  ...\n  syntax_css # yields stylesheet tags for both twilight and sunburst\n

Perl","readme":"\nPerlanet\n--------\n\nNAME\n\n  Perlanet\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWHAT IS Perlanet?\n\n  Perlanet is a Perl module for aggregating web feeds.\n\n  It allows you to aggregate a number of web feeds (both Atom and RSS) and\n  to publish a web page and another web feed containing the aggregated\n  content.\n\nHOW DO I INSTALL IT?\n\n  Perlanet uses the standard Perl module architecture and can therefore by\n  installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief, goes something\n  like this:\n\n    gzip -cd Perlanet-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -\n    cd Perlanet-X.XX\n    perl Build.PL\n    ./Build\n    ./Build test\n    ./Build install\n\n  Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are installing.\n\n  You can also install it using either the 'cpan' or 'cpanp' command line\n  programs.\n\nWHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?\n\n  All of the documentation is in POD format.

Primarily used to test that Cucumber works with RoR.","readme":"This is a completely bare-bones Rails app that serves one single purpose:\n\nh2. Test that Cucumber works with Ruby on Rails\n\nHere is how:\n\n<pre># Install gems\nsudo gem install webrat rspec rspec-rails\ngit clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-rails-test.git\ncd cucumber-rails-test\nrake\n</pre>\n\nThe default task will vendor copies of Rails and Cucumber the first time it is run,\nand pull changes after that. If you'd like to start fresh, just delete the vendor/rails\nand vendor/plugins/cucumber directories and run rake again.\n\nTo Test with a specific version of Rails, e.g. 2.2.2:\n<pre># Make sure you have a vendored copy of Rails and Cucumber\nrake cucumber_test:update\nrake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test\n</pre>\n\n<pre># Test with Spork:\nCUCUMBER_GENERATE_OPTS=--spork rake cucumber_test:v2.2.2:test\n</pre>\n\nIf it's green, everything is OK. If not, you should see red.\n\nTo see a list of all available testing tasks, run <code>rake -T cucumber_test</code>\n\nh2. Adding new features\n\nThe <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks will *REVERT ALL LOCAL CHANGES* when run. Therefore, if you're modifying things, I recommend you don't run this task, but <code>rake features</code> instead. Then *MAKE SURE YOU ADD AND COMMIT* the files you changed before you run any of the <code>cucumber_test:*</code> tasks again. Make sure you don't add too much. The files that are generated should *not* be added to Git.\n\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":21533},{"lang":"JavaScript","bytes":148}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers/application.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/failing_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/lorries_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/helpers/application_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/lorries_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/models/lorry.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/user.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/layouts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/layouts/application.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/lorries","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/lorries/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/lorries/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/lorries/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/lorries/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/sessions","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/sessions/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/boot.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/database_jdbcmysql.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/database_sqlite3.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environment.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/environments/development.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments/production.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments/test.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/initializers/inflections.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers/mime_types.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers/new_rails_defaults.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/locales","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/locales/en.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/routes.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db","type":"Tree"},{"path":"db/migrate","type":"Tree"},{"path":"db/migrate/20081212000430_create_lorries.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20090419184421_create_users.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20090813192133_add_colour_to_lorries.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/README_FOR_APP","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features","type":"Tree"},{"path":"features/284_reproduce.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/325_reproduce.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/admin.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/errors.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/french.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/manage_lorries.feature","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions","type":"Tree"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/284_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/325_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/admin_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/error_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/french_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"features/step_definitions/lorry_steps.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/something","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/something/nice.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/tasks","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/tasks/cucumber_test.rake","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/tasks/default.rake","type":"Blob"},{"path":"log","type":"Tree"},{"path":"log/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public","type":"Tree"},{"path":"public/404.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/422.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/500.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/dispatch.cgi","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/dispatch.fcgi","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/dispatch.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/favicon.ico","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/images","type":"Tree"},{"path":"public/images/rails.png","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/index.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/javascripts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"public/javascripts/application.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/javascripts/controls.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/javascripts/dragdrop.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/javascripts/effects.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/javascripts/prototype.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/robots.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script","type":"Tree"},{"path":"script/about","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/console","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/dbconsole","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/destroy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/generate","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/performance","type":"Tree"},{"path":"script/performance/benchmarker","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/performance/profiler","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/performance/request","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/plugin","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script/process","type":"Tree"},{"path":"script/process/inspector","type":"Blob"},{"path":"scrip

Bed is a generic Solr interface for models, because models are too sexy to get the their tans from the sun directly ;-) ","readme":"tanning_bed\n    by Rob Kaufman (notch8.com)\n    with permission and support from the Assay Depot (assaydepot.com)\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nTanning Bed is Solr for models.\nTanning Bed provides a Ruby interface for the Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) search engine to use in you're models not matter whether they are Datamapper, Active Record, Couchrest or just general Ruby classes.\n\n== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:\n\n* Incredibly simple in design, no fancy hooks\n* Very Ruby\n* {Ruby 1.9 Compatible}[http://notch8.github.com/files/Ruby19Badge.png]\n\n== SYNOPSIS:\n\n=== Setup\n  Using TanningBed for a given class involves including the TanningBed model and then implementing a few (easy) methods.\n   \n  Objects must implement:\n  \n  * id - unique identifier for the record\n  * Class.get - this method receives and object's id and loads it\n  * solr_keys - an array of method names, the method results will be added to the index\n\n==== Examples\n\n===== CouchRest\n  id is already implemented and so is get.  CouchRest has a method called keys which we'll use\n  \n    class MyDocument < CouchRest::Model\n      include TanningBed\n      \n      key_accessor :name\n      key_accessor :address\n      \n      def solr_keys\n        keys\n      end\n  \n===== ActiveRecord\n\n  id is implemented in ActiveRecord already\n  \n   class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\n     include TanningBed\n     \n     def get(value)\n       find(value)\n     end\n     \n     def solr_keys\n       attribute_names\n     end\n   end\n\n=== Adding, Updating or Deleting\n  Adding a record is accomplished by calling solr_add\n  Update is solr_update\n  Delete is solr_delete\n  \n=== Search\n   TanningBed.solr_search(\"Big\")\n   \n==== Limit to item\n   result = ModelName.solr_search\n   @models = ModelName.solr_load(result)\n  \n=== Changing Solr connection\n  To change the url for Solr or to change whether autocommit is on or not add the following to you're instantiation (for example config/enviroments/production.rb) \n  \n   TanningBed.solr_connection(YOUR_SOLR_URL, :off)\n   \n=== Handling connection issues\n  Only you can decide the best way to handle Solr exceptions in your application.  TanningBed provides a simple hook to allow you to do just that.  By default connection exceptions (Errno::ECONNREFUSED) in TanningBed methods simply output to STDERR.  This isn't really sufficient unless you're watching STDERR on you're application for problems.  A common thing to want to do is simply be notified of the error while failing silently.  To do that you might setup something like this: \n  \n   TanningBed.on_solr_exception = Proc.new {|e| deliver_solr_down_email(e) } \n   \n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Solr (bundled)\n* Solr-Ruby library

merb slice for alerting users when model objects they’re “watching” are saved.","readme":"merb\\_watchable\n==============\n\nMerbWatchable sends you emails when your stuff is modified. It's built for merb\n1.0.3+, and currently assuming DataMapper.\n\nmerb\\_watchable is a pretty simple slice for alerting users when model objects\nthey're \"watching\" are saved. Right now, it assumes that you have a User class\ncalled `User` (sorry about that, hope to fix soon for those of you `Person`\nclass authors) with a field called `email` (once again, apologies).\n\nconfig\n------\n\nUnfortunately not much config at the moment, this is pretty bare. You can\nspecify the \"from:\" in the email with the following:\n\n    Merb::Slices::config[:merb_watchable][:sender] = 'your.email@here.com'\n\nAdd that to your `Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads` and you should be in good\nshape. Obviously, make sure you've required merb-mailers and that your Merb\nMailer config is in good working order.\n\nHere's an example of a model:\n\n    class WatchedModel\n      include DataMapper::Resource\n      property :id, Serial\n      property :title, String\n      \n      is :watchable, :label => :title\n    end\n\nNote the `is :watchable` part there. Stick that in your model, and your model\nwill be, well, watchable. The :label option allows you to specify how the model\nwill be referred to. If you don't specify anything, watchable will assume that\nyou have a field in your model called \"name\", and will show that field in the\nemail.\n\nusing merb\\_watchable\n--------------------\n\nThe slice will automatically add a `watches` table to keep track of what objects\nare currently being watched. To those of you writing merb apps dedicated to\nwrist watches, again, I apologize. Here's what you need to do in order to\nspecify that the current user is watching an object:\n\n    Watch.create(:watcher => session.current_user, :watchable => your_object)\n\nVoila, you're done. (Or as I once overheard, \"Viola! You're done!\") Check the\n[TODO](TODO) page for what needs to be done (which is a lot, at the moment).\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":15884}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.markdown","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"TODO","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/database.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/init.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/router.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/dm","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/dm/dm_watchable.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/dm/watch.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/merb_watchable.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/merb_watchable","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/merb_watchable/merbtasks.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/merb_watchable/slicetasks.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/merb_watchable/spectasks.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"merb_watchable.gemspec","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/controllers/main_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/lib/watch_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/lib/watchable_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/merb_watchable_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/spec_helper.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"no gem on github yet, maybe this blank line will convince them"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"added gemspec"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"carpeliam","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"carpeliam","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"add stuff to the heap of stuff needed to make this worth using"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"escaped '_' and changed default :label to :name"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"deleted a ton of stuff, added markdown README, removed generated private\nAPI call"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"added Merb.run_later, got tests to pass (without run_later)"},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"after(:save) is being called twice, but we're getting somewhere."},"author_login":"carpeliam","committer_login":"carpeliam"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Liam Morley","email":"liam@carpeliam.com"},"message":"Initial commit, more of a statement of purpose than anything else.

It's intended for beginners, but it should provide a reasonable\nworking environment for anyone using Emacs for dynamic languages. The\nmain advantage of the Starter Kit is that it provides better default\nsettings and bundles many useful libraries.\n\nThe latest version is at http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/\n\n## Learning\n\nThis won't teach you Emacs, but it'll make it easier to get\ncomfortable. To access the tutorial, press control-h followed by t.\n\nYou may also find the [PeepCode Meet Emacs\nscreencast](http://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs) helpful. The\n[Emacs Wiki](http://emacswiki.org) is also very handy.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install Emacs (at least version 22)\n   Use your package manager if you have one.\n   Otherwise, Mac users should get it [from Apple](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/carbonemacspackage.html).\n   Windows users can get it [from GNU](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-22.3-bin-i386.zip).\n2. Move the directory containing this file to ~/.emacs.d [1]\n   (If you already have a directory at ~/.emacs.d move it out of the way and put this there instead.)\n3. Launch Emacs!\n\nIf you are missing some autoloads after an update (should manifest\nitself as \"void function: foobar\" errors) try M-x regen-autoloads.\n\nIf you want to keep your regular ~/.emacs.d in place and just launch a\nsingle instance using the starter kit, try the following invocation:\n\n  $ emacs -q -l ~/src/emacs-starter-kit/init.el\n\nNote that having a ~/.emacs file might override the starter kit\nloading, so if you've having trouble loading it, make sure that file\nis not present.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe init.el file is where everything begins. It's the first file to\nget loaded. The starter-kit-* files provide what I consider to be\nbetter defaults, both for different programming languages and for\nbuilt-in Emacs features like bindings or registers.\n\nFiles that are pending submission to ELPA are bundled with the starter\nkit under the directory elpa-to-submit/. The understanding is that\nthese are bundled just because nobody's gotten around to turning them\ninto packages, and the bundling of them is temporary. For these\nlibraries, autoloads will be generated and kept in the loaddefs.el\nfile. This allows them to be loaded on demand rather than at startup.\n\nThere are also a few files that are meant for code that doesn't belong\nin the Starter Kit. First, the user-specific-config file is the file\nnamed after your user with the extension \".el\". In addition, if a\ndirectory named after your user exists, it will be added to the\nload-path, and any elisp files in it will be loaded. Finally, the\nStarter Kit will look for a file named after the current hostname\nending in \".el\" which will allow host-specific configuration. This is\nwhere you should put code that you don't think would be useful to\neveryone. That will allow you to merge with newer versions of the\nstarter-kit without conflicts.\n\n## Emacs Lisp Package Archive\n\nLibraries from [ELPA](http://tromey.com/elpa) are preferred when\navailable since dependencies are handled automatically, and the burden\nto update them is removed from the user. In the long term, ideally\neverything would be installed via ELPA, and only package.el would need\nto be distributed with the starter kit. (Or better yet, package.el\nwould come with Emacs...) See starter-kit-elpa.el for a list of\nlibraries that are pending submission to ELPA. Packages get installed\nin the elpa/ directory.\n\nThere's no vendor/ directory in the starter kit because if an external\nlibrary is useful enough to be bundled with the starter kit, it should\nbe useful enough to submit to ELPA so that everyone can use it, not\njust users of the starter kit.\n\nSometimes packages are removed from the Starter Kit as they get added\nto ELPA itself. This has occasionally caused problems with certain\npackages. If you run into problems with such a package, try removing\neverything from inside the elpa/ directory and invoking M-x\nstarter-kit-elpa-install in a fresh instance.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you know your way around Emacs, please try out the starter kit as a\nreplacement for your regular dotfiles for a while. If there's anything\nyou just can't live without, add it or let me know so I can add\nit. Take a look at what happens in init.el to get started.\n\nAlso: see the file TODO. Helping submit new libraries to ELPA is the\neasiest way to help out. There are two ways you can do this: either\ntake new libraries and make them ready for ELPA, dropping them in the\nelpa-to-submit directory or take files that are already in\nelpa-to-submit, ensuring all their dependencies are correctly loaded\ninto ELPA, and sending them to the ELPA maintainer. There are details\nat http://tromey.com/elpa/upload.html for how ELPA submission\nworks. Grep the project for TODO for other things.\n\nFiles are licensed under the same license as Emacs unless otherwise\nspecified.

(thanks Paolo Dona) \n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the gem from github\n\n    gem install guillaumegentil-import_fu --source http://gems.github.com\n    \nAdd the gem to your Rails environment.rb file:\n\n    config.gem \"guillaumegentil-import_fu\", :lib => \"import_fu\", :source => \"http://gems.github.com\"\n    \nInclude import_fu in your ActiveRecord Model:\n\n    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base\n      include ImportFu\n    end\n    \n## Usage\n\nImport from an array of values\n\n    columns = [:name, :size]\n    values = [[\"toto\", \"32\"],\n              [\"tata\", \"33\"]]\n    \n    Foo.import columns, values\n\nImport from a csv file (MySQL needs to have access on this file, so be sure it has the proper ownership/permissions)\n\n    columns = [:name, :size]\n    \n    Foo.import columns, '/path/of/a/csv'\n    \n### Options\n\nBy default ImportFu adds timestamps values (Time.now.utc) when importing from an array, this can be avoided with:\n\n    Foo.import columns, values, :timestamps => false\n    \nBy default ImportFu does NOT reformat values passed in the array (like Time or Data value), if you want the reformat use:\n\n    Foo.import columns, values, :format => true\n    \nBy default ImportFu does NOT replace already existing values in database and ignores them (like values with an id already used), if you want the replace behavior use:\n\n    Foo.import columns, values, :replace => true\n    \nIf your Rails app and your MySQL database are on the same machine, you can speed up the import by passing:\n\n    Foo.import columns, values, :local => true\n\n## Author\n\nThibaud

android BPMF(Phonetic) IME","readme":"KerKerInput(IMF) Readme\r\n==================================\r\nThe new KerKerInput is now a input method framework on the existing Android IMF.\r\nIts goal is to provide common used components such as Virtual Keyboard, Physical\r\nKB <=> Virtual KB keycode conversion, candidates mechanism and most importantly\r\nthe .cin file support.\r\n\r\nI hope this framework could be a starter kit or used as a starting point to\r\ndevelop your own Android IME in (mostly Traditional) Chinese.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status\r\n==============\r\nKerKerInput is currently working on the Android version 1.5 and after.\r\nNow we provide a few basic input method support and a fun barcode input method,\r\nwe also provided some basic demostration modules in the code to show you how\r\nthe modules mechanism working.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is planned. However, due to limited resources, I cannot focus\r\non this right now. If you would like to see KerKerInput being more actively\r\ndeveloped, please consider a donation. Don't worry, I will still working on this\r\nproject right now.\r\n\r\nCurrent WIP\r\n==============\r\nHere are few things I am working on right now:\r\n\r\n  - Documentation\r\n  - Common .cin based input module\r\n  - Cleanup dirty codes\r\n  - Make barcode recognition works better\r\n  \r\nYou're welcomed to contribute your patch/code by using the github or\r\nemail me the patch alone with your contact information for the credit. :)\r\n  \r\nKnown Issues\r\n=============\r\n\r\n  - Some interaction during switching IME or re-open the IME on another textbox\r\n    is not very smooth.\r\n  - Camera only works on HTC phones for now. Need document for raw camera source\r\n    data for phones from other manufactures. \r\n  - Camera aspect is incorrect.\r\n  - ... (a lot of bugs here.)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=============\r\n The full code sweep for licensing issues is being working on, but all the framework\r\n parts are written by me, and will be using MIT license.\r\n   \r\n    Copyright (c) 2008-2009 Chien-An Cho(itsZero)\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n    obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\n    files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\n    restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\n    copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n    Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\n    conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\n    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n    NONINFRINGEMENT.

for extracting information from a git repository in an object oriented manner.","readme":"Grit\n====\n\nGrit gives you object oriented read/write access to Git repositories via Ruby.\nThe main goals are stability and performance. To this end, some of the\ninteractions with Git repositories are done by shelling out to the system's\n`git` command, and other interactions are done with pure Ruby\nreimplementations of core Git functionality. This choice, however, is\ntransparent to end users, and you need not know which method is being used.\n\nThis software was developed to power GitHub, and should be considered\nproduction ready. An extensive test suite is provided to verify its correctness.\n\nGrit is maintained by Tom Preston-Werner, Scott Chacon, Chris Wanstrath, and\nPJ Hyett.\n\nThis documentation is accurate as of Grit 1.0.2.\n\n\n## Requirements #############################################################\n\n* git (http://git-scm.com) tested with 1.6.0.2\n\n\n## Install ##################################################################\n\nEasiest install is via RubyGems:\n\n    $ gem install grit\n\nor\n\n    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/ (you only need to do this once)\n    $ gem install mojombo-grit\n\nThe gem from GitHub will generally be available sooner than the gem from\nRubyforge. Both sources will eventually contain the same releases.\n\n\n## Source ###################################################################\n\nGrit's Git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:\n\n    http://github.com/mojombo/grit\n\nand cloned with:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mojombo/grit.git\n\n\n## Usage ####################################################################\n\nGrit gives you object model access to your Git repositories. Once you have\ncreated a `Repo` object, you can traverse it to find parent commits,\ntrees, blobs, etc.\n\n### Initialize a Repo object\n\nThe first step is to create a `Grit::Repo` object to represent your repo. In\nthis documentation I include the `Grit` module to reduce typing.\n\n    require 'grit'\n    include Grit\n    repo = Repo.new(\"/Users/tom/dev/grit\")\n\nIn the above example, the directory `/Users/tom/dev/grit` is my working\ndirectory and contains the `.git` directory. You can also initialize Grit with\na bare repo.\n\n    repo = Repo.new(\"/var/git/grit.git\")\n\n### Getting a list of commits\n\nFrom the `Repo` object, you can get a list of commits as an array of `Commit`\nobjects.\n\n    repo.commits\n    # => [#<Grit::Commit \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\">,\n          #<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">,\n          #<Grit::Commit \"038af8c329ef7c1bae4568b98bd5c58510465493\">,\n          #<Grit::Commit \"40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe\">,\n          #<Grit::Commit \"4ea50f4754937bf19461af58ce3b3d24c77311d9\">]\n\nCalled without arguments, `Repo#commits` returns a list of up to ten commits\nreachable by the **master** branch (starting at the latest commit). You can\nask for commits beginning at a different branch, commit, tag, etc.\n\n    repo.commits('mybranch')\n    repo.commits('40d3057d09a7a4d61059bca9dca5ae698de58cbe')\n    repo.commits('v0.1')\n\nYou can specify the maximum number of commits to return.\n\n    repo.commits('master', 100)\n\nIf you need paging, you can specify a number of commits to skip.\n\n    repo.commits('master', 10, 20)\n\nThe above will return commits 21-30 from the commit list.\n\n### The Commit object\n\n`Commit` objects contain information about that commit.\n\n    head = repo.commits.first\n\n    head.id\n    # => \"e80bbd2ce67651aa18e57fb0b43618ad4baf7750\"\n\n    head.parents\n    # => [#<Grit::Commit \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">]\n\n    head.tree\n    # => #<Grit::Tree \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\">\n\n    head.author\n    # => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\n    head.authored_date\n    # => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\n    head.committer\n    # => #<Grit::Actor \"Tom Preston-Werner <tom@mojombo.com>\">\n\n    head.committed_date\n    # => Wed Oct 24 22:02:31 -0700 2007\n\n    head.message\n    # => \"add Actor inspect\"\n\nYou can traverse a commit's ancestry by chaining calls to `#parents`.\n\n    repo.commits.first.parents[0].parents[0].parents[0]\n\nThe above corresponds to **master^^^** or **master~3** in Git parlance.\n\n### The Tree object\n\nA tree records pointers to the contents of a directory. Let's say you want\nthe root tree of the latest commit on the **master** branch.\n\n    tree = repo.commits.first.tree\n    # => #<Grit::Tree \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\">\n\n    tree.id\n    # => \"3536eb9abac69c3e4db583ad38f3d30f8db4771f\"\n\nOnce you have a tree, you can get the contents.\n\n    contents = tree.contents\n    # => [#<Grit::Blob \"4ebc8aea50e0a67e000ba29a30809d0a7b9b2666\">,\n          #<Grit::Blob \"81d2c27608b352814cbe979a6acd678d30219678\">,\n          #<Grit::Tree \"c3d07b0083f01a6e1ac969a0f32b8d06f20c62e5\">,\n          #<Grit::Tree \"4d00fe177a8407dbbc64a24dbfc564762c0922d8\">]\n\nThis tree contains two `Blob` objects and two `Tree` objects. The trees are\nsubdirectories and the blobs are files. Trees below the root have additional\nattributes.\n\n    contents.last.name\n    # => \"lib\"\n\n    contents.last.mode\n    # => \"040000\"\n\nThere is a convenience method that allows you to get a named sub-object\nfrom a tree.\n\n    tree / \"lib\"\n    # => #<Grit::Tree \"e74893a3d8a25cbb1367cf241cc741bfd503c4b2\">\n\nYou can also get a tree directly from the repo if you know its name.\n\n    repo.tree\n    # => #<Grit::Tree \"master\">\n\n    repo.tree(\"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\")\n    # => #<Grit::Tree \"91169e1f5fa4de2eaea3f176461f5dc784796769\">\n\n### The Blob object\n\nA blob represents a file. Trees often contain blobs.\n\n    blob = tree.contents.first\n    # => #<Grit::Blob \"4ebc8aea50e0a67e000ba29a30809d0a7b9b2666\">\n\nA blob has certain attributes.\n\n    blob.id\n    # => \"4ebc8aea50e0a67e000ba29a30809d0a7b9b2666\"\n\n    blob.name\n    # => \"README.txt\"\n\n    blob.mode\n    # => \"100644\"\n\n    blob.size\n    # => 7726\n\nYou can get the data of a blob as a

The main issues related\nto Grit are encodings, and the [] method.  The GitRuby implementation\ncurrently uses code such as \"buf[offset]\" to access a byte (1 uint8_t byte in C)\nof data. It would be nice to just use String#getbyte(offset), but this method is not\nsensitive to the string encoding.  The default encoding for Ruby strings\nis UTF-8, and I can't figure out how to make sure that all of the encodings\nare correct such that String#getbyte will return the right value.\n\nIn Ruby 1.8, String[offset] returns the integer code of the character at offset.\nIn Ruby 1.9, String[offset] returns the actual character at offset. To get the integer\nvalue, we need to call String#ord, which returns the int code of the first char.\nThus, to get Ruby 1.8 behavior in Ruby 1.9, we would need to call String[offset].ord.\nMy solution for now is just to define a getord(offset) method in a version dependent\nmanner, and use this in place of String[offset].

bindings for Strophe, a C library for writing XMPP clients","readme":"= strophe_ruby\n\nhttp://stropheruby.rubyforge.org\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nRuby bindings for Strophe 'http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/', a C library for \nwriting XMPP clients. If all you need is a simple XMPP bot that\nreact to message and presence notifications, you might be better off\nwith XMPPBot 'http://github.com/flamontagne/xmppbot/', which is an implementation I wrote on top of StropheRuby.\n\nNote that this gem is quite experimental and is not ready for production.\n\nStrophe 'http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/' is a robust and well written \nC library that allows the developer to implement XMPP clients.\n\nI wanted to be able to use the power of this library with the ruby \nsyntax. I didn't use SWIG to generate the bindings for 2 reasons :\n\n1. I wanted to learn how to write a C extension for ruby\n2. I didn't like how SWIG generate gazilions of lines of code\n\nMy other project, XMPPBot, is an implementation of Strophe Ruby that \nallows the ruby developer to write a XMPP bot in a few lines of code.\n\n== INSTALL:\n\ngem install strophe_ruby\n\n== CURRENT PROBLEMS:\n\n- Currently no Support for TLS encryption\n- Cannot terminate the loop with CTRL-C\n- Socket disconnects after being inactive for too long\n- Cannot output log data to a file\n\n== EXAMPLE OF USE\n\n  require 'strophe_ruby'\n\n  def announce_presence\n    stanza = StropheRuby::Stanza.new\n    stanza.name =

locally,\njust clone this repo and start the bundled copy of Merb:\n\n\t\t$ ./bin/merb\n\t\t\nAnd open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser\n\nNote that you might have to \"redeploy\" the native gems\nif the <tt>merb</tt> app server doesn't start:\n\n\t\t$ ./bin/thor merb:gem:redeploy\n\nA static HTML and a PDF version will soon be available online.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n * Fork this project\n * Modify, fix, add content\n * send me a pull request\n\nFor the moment, the content of the book\nis located inside <tt>./book-content/</tt>\nand is organized by languages, chapters, and pages.\n\nChapters and pages must be lowercase and start by a digit\nfollowed by a dash and the chapter/page title\nwithout spaces or any non ascii characters.\n\nAll content files are Markdown files;\nthe <tt>merb</tt> app uses [maruku][] to render these files.\nCheck the [supported syntax][]\nor check ./book-content/en/1-introduction/1-ruby.markdown\nfor a good example of how to use images, quotes, and CSS selectors.\n\nThe book supports multiple languages.\nEach language needs to replicate the English folder structure,\nusing the *same* file names.\n\nIf you are copying a page or chapter to your language folder\nand want to mark a section of your text as requiring translation,\njust add the <tt>to-translate</tt> class\nto the CSS selector of your content, as shown below:\n\n    {: .to-translate}\n\nPlease follow our editor guidelines, especially:\n\n* use a language branch (so you can see what changed in the English content)\n* one sentence per line (so merging is easier)\n\n<http://groups.google.com/group/merb-book/web/guidelines>\n\n## Translation leaders\n\n* Bosnian:     http://github.com/sidonath (Damir ZekiÄ‡)\n* Chinese:     http://github.com/zhhz

control plugin for Rails","readme":"Welcome to the acl_system plugin for rails. This plugin is designed to give you a \nflexible declarative way of protecting your various controller actions using roles.\nIt's made to site on top of any authentication framework that follows a few conventions.\nYou will need to have a current_user method that returns the currently logged in user. \nAnd you will need to make your User or Account model(or whatever you named it) have a\nhas_and_belongs_to_many :roles. So you need a model called Role that has a title attribute.\nOnce these two things are satisfied you can use this plugin.\n\nSo lets take a look at the sugar you get from using this plugin. Keep in mind that the\n!blacklist part isnâ€™t really necessary here. I was just showing it as an example of how\nflexible the permissions string logic parser is. \n\nclass PostController < ApplicationController\n  before_filter :login_required, :except => [:list, :index]\n  access_control [:new, :create, :update, :edit] => '(admin | user | moderator)',\n                 :delete => 'admin & (!moderator & !blacklist)' \n\nOf course you can define them all seperately if they differ at all.\n\nclass PostController < ApplicationController\n  before_filter :login_required, :except => [:list, :index]\n  access_control :new => '(admin | user | moderator) & !blacklist',\n                 :create => 'admin & !blacklist',\n                 :edit => '(admin | moderator) & !blacklist',\n                 :update => '(admin | moderator) & !blacklist',\n                 :delete => 'admin & (!moderator | !blacklist)' \n\nAnd you can also use :DEFAULT if you have a lot of actions that need the same permissions.\n\nclass PostController < ApplicationController\n  before_filter :login_required, :except => [:list, :index]\n  access_control :DEFAULT => '!guest' \n                [:new, :create, :update, :edit] => '(admin | user | moderator)',\n                 :delete => 'admin & (!moderator & !blacklist)'\n\nThere are two callback methods you can use to define your own success and failure behaviors.\nIf you define permission_granted and/or permission_denied  as protected methods in your controller you\ncan redirect or render and error page or whatever else you might want to do if access is allowed\nor denied.\n\nclass PostController < ApplicationController\n  before_filter :login_required, :except => [:list, :index]\n  access_control :DEFAULT => '!guest' \n                [:new, :create, :update, :edit] => '(admin | user | moderator)',\n                 :delete => 'admin & (!moderator & !blacklist)'\n\n  # the rest of your controller here\n\n  protected\n\n  def permission_denied\n    flash[:notice] = \"You don't have privileges to access this action\"\n    return redirect_to :action => 'denied'\n  end\n\n  def permission_granted\n    flash[:notice] = \"Welcome to the secure area of foo.com!\"\n  end\n\nend\n\nThere is also a helper method that can be used in the view or controller. In the view its \nhandy for conditional menus or stuff like that. \n\n<% restrict_to \"(admin | moderator) & !blacklist\" do %>\n  <%= link_to \"Admin & Moderator only link\", :action =>'foo' %>\n<% end %>\n\nSo the gist of it is that in the access_control controller macro, you can assign \npermission logic strings to actions in your controller. You supply a hash of \n:action => â€˜permissions stringâ€ pairs. Any action not in the list is left open to \nany user. Any action with a logic string gets evaluated on each request to see if\n the current user has the right role to access the action. The plugin has a small \nrecursive descent parser that evaluates the permission logic strings against the \ncurrent_user.roles.\n\nThe way this works is that you have your User model and a Role model. User <= habtm => Role.\n So when an action that is access_controlâ€™ed gets requested the permission logic string \ngets evaluated against the current_user.roles . So a prerequisite of using this plugin\n is that you add a Role model with a title attribute that has_and_belongs_to_many User\n models. And you need to have a current_user method defined somewhere in your controllers \nor user system. Luckily the acts_as_authenticated plugin has the current_user defined already. \n\nSo here is the schema of this application including the Post model and the User and Role \nmodel plus the habtm join table: \n\nActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 3) do\n  create_table \"posts\", :force => true do |t|\n    t.column \"title\", :string, :limit => 40\n    t.column \"body\", :text\n  end\n  create_table \"roles\", :force => true do |t|\n    t.column \"title\", :string\n  end\n  create_table \"roles_users\", :id => false, :force => true do |t|\n    t.column \"role_id\", :integer\n    t.column \"user_id\", :integer\n  end\n  create_table \"users\", :force => true do |t|\n    t.column \"login\", :string, :limit => 40\n    t.column \"email\", :string, :limit => 100\n    t.column \"crypted_password\", :string, :limit => 40 \n    t.column \"salt\", :string, :limit => 40\n    t.column \"created_at\", :datetime\n    t.column \"updated_at\", :datetime\n  end\nend\nAnd so thats pretty much it for now. You add the roles to the Role.title attribute like admin,\n moderator and blacklist like above. These can be anything you want them to be, roles, groups\n or whatever. Then you can use as many nested parens and logic with & | ! as you want to \ndefine your complex permissions for accessing your controller. Make sure that your access_control\n gets called after the login_required before_filter because we assume that you are already \nlogged in if you made it this far and then we eval the permissions logic.\n\nYou will want to define these access_control in each controller that needs specific permissions.\n unless you want to protect the same actions in all controllers, then you can put it in \napplication.rb but I dont recommend it.","language":[{"lang":"","bytes":0}],"repository":[{"path":"LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"init.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/caboose","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/caboose/access_control.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/caboose/logic_parser.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/caboose/role_handler.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/access_control_test.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/test_helper.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Oleg Shaldybin","email":"oleg.shaldybin@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Oleg Shaldybin","email":"oleg.shaldybin@gmail.com"},"message":"Call to render_text changed to render :text"},"author_login":"olegshaldybin","committer_login":"olegshaldybin"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"fixed bug.\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@146 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":" added downcase to role comparison so that upercase roles will be handled correctly.\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@145 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"Fixed bug with default hash when no block is given.\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@86 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"fix readme\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@84 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"fixed restrict_to example in the README\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@81 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"updated README\n\ngit-svn-id: http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/acl_system2@80 e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"author_login":"","committer_login":""},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"commiter":{"name":"ezra","email":"ezra@e8081bd4-020a-0410-a7c4-8039225954a7"},"message":"Fixed things to work properly.

to call subroutines using approximate names","readme":"\n#Symbol::Approx::Sub#\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davorg/symbol-approx-sub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davorg/symbol-approx-sub) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/davorg/symbol-approx-sub/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/davorg/symbol-approx-sub?branch=master)\n\n##What is Symbol::Approx::Sub?##\n\nSymbol::Approx::Sub is a Perl module which allows you to call subroutines\nusing approximate names.\n\nOf course, why you might want to do that is a completely different\nquestion. You almost certainly don't want to do it in production\ncode as it will make your program almost completely unmaintainable.\n\nI only wrote this module to test my understanding of typeglobs and\nAUTOLOAD. I really don't expect it to have any sensible uses at all\n(but if you find one, I'd be interested in knowing what it is).\n\n##How Do I Install It?\n\nSymbol::Approx::Sub uses the standard Perl module architecture and can\ntherefore by installed using the standard Perl method which, in\nbrief, goes something like this:\n\n```unix\n   gzip -cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -\n   cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX\n   perl Makefile.PL\n   make\n   make test\n   make install\n```\n\nWhere X.XX is the version number of the module which you are \ninstalling.\n\nIf this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called \nSymbol/Approx somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying \nthe Sub.pm file into this directory should also do the trick.\n\n\n##Prerequisites##\n\nAs of version 1.03, Symbol::Approx::Sub uses Devel::Symdump to do\nall of the clever glob-walking stuff, so you'll need to get that from\nCPAN and install it before installing Symbol::Approx::Sub.\n\n##Where is the Documentation?##\n\nAll of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Approx.pm\nfile. If you install the module using the standard method you should\nbe able to read it by typing\n\n```unix\n   perldoc Symbol::Approx::Sub\n```\n\nat a command prompt.\n\n##Latest Version\n\nThe latest version of this module will always be available from\nCPAN.\n\n##Copyright##\n\nCopyright (c) 2000, Magnum Solutions Ltd.

clean, simple, and unobtrusive ruby authentication solution.","readme":"= Authlogic\n\nAuthlogic is a clean, simple, and unobtrusive ruby authentication solution. Put simply, its the Chuck Norris of authentication solutions for your framework of choice.\n\nSo what is Authlogic, and why would I create a solution to a problem that already has plenty of solutions? Because none of the solutions felt right to me, RESTful development and authentication just didn't seem to go well together. It was like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. All of the current solutions, for both rails and merb, just seemed to force that square peg in the round hole for me. Just because they did it for me doesn't make it right. They were either too complicated, bloated, littered my application with tons of code, had no platform for reasonable updating, used an inferior encryption algorithm, or were just confusing. This is not the simple / elegant ruby we all fell in love with. We need a \"ruby like\" authentication solution. Authlogic is my attempt to satisfy that need...\n\nLet's take a rails application...\n\nWouldn't it be nice to keep your app up to date with the latest and greatest security techniques with a simple update of a gem?\n\nWhat if you could have authentication up and running in minutes without having to run a generator? All because it's simple, like everything else.\n\nWhat if creating a user session could be as simple as...\n\n  UserSession.create(params[:user_session])\n\nWhat if your user sessions controller could look just like your other controllers...\n\n  class UserSessionsController < ApplicationController\n    def new\n      @user_session = UserSession.new\n    end\n    \n    def create\n      @user_session = UserSession.new(params[:user_session])\n      if @user_session.save\n        redirect_to account_url\n      else\n        render :action => :new\n      end\n    end\n    \n    def destroy\n      current_user_session.destroy\n      redirect_to new_user_session_url\n    end\n  end\n\nLook familiar? If you didn't know any better, you would think UserSession was an ActiveRecord model. I think that's pretty cool, because it fits nicely into the RESTful development pattern, a style we all know and love. What about the view...\n\n  <% form_for @user_session do |f| %>\n    <%= f.error_messages %>\n    <%= f.label :login %><br />\n    <%= f.text_field :login %><br />\n    <br />\n    <%= f.label :password %><br />\n    <%= f.password_field :password %><br />\n    <br />\n    <%= f.submit \"Login\" %>\n  <% end %>\n\nOr how about persisting the session...\n\n  class ApplicationController\n    helper_method :current_user_session, :current_user\n    \n    private\n      def current_user_session\n        return @current_user_session if defined?(@current_user_session)\n        @current_user_session = UserSession.find\n      end\n      \n      end current_user\n        return @current_user if defined?(@current_user)\n        @current_user = current_user_session && current_user_session.user\n      end\n  end\n\nAuthlogic and REST are like peas and carrots, as Forrest Gump would say. But This is just the tip of the ice berg.

The names of these columns can be changed with configuration. Better yet, Authlogic tries to guess these names by checking for the existence of common names. See Authlogic::Session::Config::ClassMethods for more details, but chances are you won't have to specify any configuration for your field names, even if they aren't the same names as below.\n\n    t.string    :login,                 :null => false\n    t.string    :crypted_password,      :null => false\n    t.string    :password_salt,         :null => false # not needed if you are encrypting your pw instead of using a hash algorithm.\n    t.string    :persistence_token,     :null => false\n    t.string    :single_access_token,   :null => false # optional, see the tokens section below.\n    t.string    :perishable_token,      :null => false # optional, see the tokens section below.\n    t.integer   :login_count,           :null => false, :default => 0 # optional, this is a \"magic\" column, see the magic columns section below\n\n=== Set up your model\n\nMake sure you have a model that you will be authenticating with. For this example let's say you have a User model:\n\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_authentic # for options see documentation: Authlogic::ORMAdapters::ActiveRecordAdapter::ActsAsAuthentic::Config\n  end\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that the default :crypto_provider for Authlogic is Sha512. You are *NOT* forced to use this. See the encryption methods section below for more information.\n\nYou are all set, now go use it just like you would with any other ActiveRecord model. Either glance at the code at the beginning of this README or check out the tutorials (see above in \"helpful links\") for a more detailed walk through.\n\n== Migrating an existing app from restful_authentication and upgrading your encryption\n\nFor those that are switching existing apps over, I made an option especially for you. Just do the following and everything will be taken care of, your users won't even know anything changed:\n\n  # app/models/user.rb\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_authentic :act_like_restful_authentication => true\n  end\n\nThe above will not change a thing, from your database's perspective it will be as if you are still using restful_authentication.\n\nOr you can upgrade from Sha1 and transition your users to a much more secure encryption algorithm:\n\n  # app/models/user.rb\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_authentic :transition_from_restful_authentication => true\n  end\n\nBy default this will switch your users to Authlogic's Sha512 implementation. You do *NOT* have to use this. Check out the encryption methods section below for a list of encryption methods Authlogic provides you. If you want to use something besides Sha512 just specify it by doing:\n\n  # app/models/user.rb\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_authentic :transition_from_restful_authentication => true,\n      :crypto_provider => Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt\n  end\n\nEvery time a user logs in their password will be upgraded and every time a new account is created it will use the new algorithm all while allowing users to login with the old algorithm.\n\nFor more information checkout my blog post on this: http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/11/23/tutorial-easily-migrate-from-restful_authentication-to-authlogic\n\n== Magic Columns\n\nJust like ActiveRecord has \"magic\" columns, such as: created_at and updated_at. Authlogic has its own \"magic\" columns too:\n\n  Column name           Description\n  login_count           Increased every time an explicit login is made. This will *NOT* increase if logging in by a session, cookie, or basic http auth\n  last_request_at       Updates every time the user logs in, either by explicitly logging in, or logging in by cookie, session, or http auth\n  current_login_at      Updates with the current time when an explicit login is made.\n  last_login_at         Updates with the value of current_login_at before it is reset.\n  current_login_ip      Updates with the request remote_ip when an explicit login is made.\n  last_login_ip         Updates with the value of current_login_ip before it is reset.\n  \n== Magic States\n\nAuthlogic tries to check the state of the record before creating the session. If your record responds to the following methods and any of them return false, validation will fail:\n\n  Method name           Description\n  active?               Is the record marked as active?\n  approved?             Has the record been approved?\n  confirmed?            Has the record been conirmed?\n\nAuthlogic does nothing to define these methods for you, its up to you to define what they mean. If your object responds to these methods Authlogic will use them, otherwise they are ignored.\n  \nWhat's neat about this is that these are checked upon any type of login. When logging in explicitly, by cookie, session, or basic http auth. So if you mark a user inactive in the middle of their session they wont be logged back in next time they refresh the page. Giving you complete control.\n\nNeed Authlogic to check your own \"state\"? No problem, check out the hooks section below. Add in a before_validation to do your own checking. The sky is the limit.\n\n== Hooks / Callbacks\n\nJust like ActiveRecord you can create your own hooks / callbacks so that you can do whatever you want when certain actions are performed. Such as before_save, after_save, etc.\n\n  before_create\n  after_create\n  \n  before_destroy\n  after_destroy\n  \n  before_find\n  after_find\n  \n  before_save\n  after_save\n  \n  before_update\n  after_update\n  \n  before_validation\n  after_validation\n\nSee Authlogic::Session::Callbacks for more information\n\n== Multiple Sessions / Session Identifiers\n\nYou're asking: \"why would I want multiple sessions?\". Take this example:\n\nYou have an app where users login and then need to re-login to view / change their billing information. Similar to how Apple's me.com works. What you could do is have the user login with their normal session, then have an entirely new session that represents their \"secure\" session. But wait, this is 2 users sessions. No problem:\n\n  # regular user session\n  @user_session = UserSession.new\n  @user_session.id\n  # => nil\n  \n  # secure user session\n  @secure_user_session = UserSession.new(:secure)\n  @secure_user_session.id\n  # => :secure\n\nThis will keep everything separate. The :secure session will store its info in a separate cookie, separate session, etc. Just set the id and you are good to go. Need to retrieve the session?\n\n  @user_session = UserSession.find\n  @secure_user_session = UserSession.find(:secure)\n\nFor more information on ids checkout Authlogic::Session::Base#id\n\n== Encryption methods\n\nAuthlogic is designed so you can use *any* encryption method you want. It delegates this task to a class of your choice. Authlogic comes preloaded with some common algorithms:\n\n1. Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha1 (used mainly for migrating from restful_authentication)\n2. Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512 (default)\n3. Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt (requires bcrypt-ruby gem)\n4. Authlogic::CryptoProviders::AES256 (requires you to supply a key, see the AES256 class in the docs for more info)\n\nBy default Authlogic uses salted Sha512 with 20 stretches, but you can easily change this. For example, if you wanted to use the BCrypt algorithm just do the following:\n\n  acts_as_authentic :crypto_provider => Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt\n\nFor more information on BCrypt checkout my blog post on it: http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/11/22/storing-nuclear-launch-codes-in-your-app-enter-bcrypt-for-authlogic\n\nAlso, check out the Authlogic::CryptoProviders module and subclasses to get an idea of how to write your own crypto provider. You don't have to use the provided classes, you can easily write your own. All that you have to do is make a class with a class level encrypt and matches? method. That's it, all of the encryption and decryption logic is left to you.\n\n== Switching to a new encryption method\n\nSwitching to a new encryption method used to be a pain in the ass. Authlogic has an option that makes this dead simple. Let's say you want to migrate to the BCrypt encryption method from Sha512:\n\n  acts_as_authentic :crypto_provider => Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt,\n    :transition_from_crypto_provider => Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512\n\nThat's it. When a user successfully logs in and is using the old method their password will be updated with the new method and all new registrations will use the new method as well. Your users won't know anything changed.\n\nBut wait, what if a couple of years later CCrypt comes out and its better than BCrypt and you're still in the middle of transitioning all of your users to BCrypt. Oh no!\n\nNot to worry, because Authlogic can transition your users from more than one algorithm. Just pass an array to :transition_from_crypto_provider\n\n  acts_as_authentic :crypto_provider => CCrypt,\n    :transition_from_crypto_provider => [Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512, Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt]\n\nThat's it, specify as many as you want. One thing to keep in mind here is that if you are using BCrypt you should never have to do this. All that you need to do is increase the cost to make the algorithm stronger, no need to jump to entirely new algorithm. I did this for example purposes only.\n\n== Tokens (persistence, resetting passwords, private feed access, etc.)\n\nTo start, let me define tokens as Authlogic sees it. A token is a form of credentials that grants some type of access to their account. Depending on the type of access, a different type of token may be needed. Put simply, it's a way for the user to say \"I am this person, let me proceed\". What types of different access you ask? Here are just a few:\n\n1. Regular account access\n2. Access to reset their password\n3. Access to a private feed\n4. Access to confirm their account\n\nThere could be many more depending on your application. What's great about Authlogic is that it doesn't care what you do or how you want to grant access to accounts. That's up to you and your application. Authlogic just cares about the type of tokens you need. Instead of giving you a token for each specific task, it gives you all of the necessary *types* of tokens, and you get to use them how you wish. It maintains the tokens and gives you all of the tools you need to use them. Just add the fields to your database and you are good to go.\n\nHere are the 3 tokens in more detail:\n\n=== 1. Persistence token (stored in cookie / session)\n\nThis token is used to persist the user's session. This is the token that is stored in the session and the cookie, so that during each request the user stays logged in. What's unique about this token is that the first time it is used the value is stored in the session, thus persisting the session. This field is required and must be in your database.\n\n=== 2. Single access token (private feed access, etc.)\n\nThis token is used for single access only, it is not persisted. Meaning the user provides it, Authlogic grants them access, and that's it. If they want access again they need to provide the token again. Authlogic will *NEVER* store this value in the session or a cookie. For added security, by default this token is *ONLY* allowed for RSS and ATOM requests. Also, this token does *NOT* change with the password. Meaning if the user changes their password, this token will remain the same. Lastly, this token uses a \"friendly\" toke (see the URL example below) so that it is easier to email / copy and paste. You can change all of this with configuration (see Authlogic::Session::config), so if you don't like how this works by default, just set some simple configuration in your session.\n\nThis field is optional, if you want to use it just add the field to your database:\n\n  t.string :single_access_token, :null => false\n  # or call it feeds_token, feed_token, or whatever you want with configuration\n\nThis is great for private feed access. So your URL to that user's private feed could look something like:\n\n  http://www.mydomain.com/account/feed.rss?single_access_token=4LiXF7FiGUppIPubBPey\n\nThe single_access_token parameter name is configurable (see Authlogic::Session::Config), but if that parameter exists Authlogic will automatically use it to try and grant that user access. You don't have to do a thing: UserSession.find will take care of it just like it does for everything else.\n\nFor more information see: Authlogic::ORMAdapters::ActiveRecordAdapter::ActsAsAuthentic::SingleAccess\n\n=== 3. Perishable token (resetting passwords, confirming accounts, etc)\n\nThis token is used for temporary account access, hence the term \"perishable\". This token is constantly changing, it changes...\n\n1. In a before_validation in your model, so basically every time the record is saved\n2. Any time a new session is successfully saved (aka logged in)\n\nThis is perfect for <b>resetting passwords</b> or <b>confirming accounts</b>. You email them a url with this token in it, and then use this token to find the record and perform your action.\n\nThis field is optional, if you want to use it just add the field to your database:\n\n  t.string :perishable_token, :null => false\n  # or call it password_reset_token, pw_reset_token, activation_token, or whatever you want with configuration\n\nFinding the record with this token couldn't be easier, Authlogic provides a special finder method that you can use. I highly recommend using it as it adds extra security:\n\n  User.find_using_perishable_token(token)\n  User.find_using_perishable_token(token, 20.minutes)\n\nThat's all you need to do to locate the record. Here is what it does for extra security:\n\n1. Ignores blank tokens all together. If a blank token is passed nil will be returned.\n2. It checks the age of the token, by default the threshold is 10 minutes, meaning if the token is older than 10 minutes, it is not valid and no record will be returned. You can change the default or just override it by passing the threshold as the second parameter. If you don't want a threshold at all, pass 0.\n\nJust like the single access token this uses a friendly token, so it is easier to email / copy and paste.\n\nFor a detailed tutorial on how to reset password using this token see the helpful links section above.\n\nFor more information see: Authlogic::ORMAdapters::ActiveRecordAdapter::ActsAsAuthentic::Perishability\n\n== Scoping\n\nScoping with authentication is a little tricky because it can come in many different flavors:\n\n1. Accounts have many users, meaning users can only belong to one account at a time.\n2. Accounts have and belong to many users, meaning a user can belong to more than one account.\n3. Users access their accounts via subdomains.\n4. Users access their accounts by selecting their account and storing their selection, *NOT* using subdomains. Maybe you store their selection in a session, cookie, or the database. It doesn't matter.\n\nNow mix and match the above, it can get pretty hairy. Fear not, because Authlogic is designed in a manner where it doesn't care how you do it, all that you have to do is break it down. When scoping a session there are 3 parts you might want to scope:\n\n1. The model (the validations, etc)\n2. The session (finding the record)\n3. The cookies (the names of the session key and cookie)\n\nI will describe each below, in order.\n\n=== Scoping your model\n\nThis scopes your login field validation, so that users are allowed to have the same login, just not in the same account.\n\n  # app/models/user.rb\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    acts_as_authentic :scope => :account_id\n  end\n\n=== Scoping your session\n\nWhen the session tries to validate it searches for a record. You want to scope that search. No problem...\n\nThe goal of Authlogic was to not try and introduce anything new. As a result I came up with:\n\n  @account.user_sessions.find\n  @account.user_sessions.create\n  @account.user_sessions.build\n  # ... etc\n\nThis works just like ActiveRecord, so it should come natural. Here is how you get this functionality:\n\n  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base\n    authenticates_many :user_sessions\n  end\n\n=== Scoping cookies\n\nWhat's neat about cookies is that if you use sub domains they automatically scope their self. Meaning if you create a cookie in whatever.yourdomain.com it will not exist in another.yourdomain.com. So if you are using subdomains to scope your users, you don't have to do anything.\n\nBut what if you *don't* want to separate your cookies by subdomains? You can accomplish this by doing:\n\n  ActionController::Base.session_options[:session_domain] = '.mydomain.com'\n\nIf for some reason the above doesn't work for you, do some simple Google searches. There are a million blog posts on this.\n\nNow let's look at this from the other angle. What if you are *NOT* using subdomains, but still want to separate cookies for each account. Simple, set the :scope_cookies option for authenticate_many:\n\n  class Account < ActiveRecord::Base\n    authenticates_many :user_sessions, :scope_cookies => true\n  end\n\nDone, Authlogic will give each cookie a unique name depending on the account.\n\nWith the above information you should be able to scope your sessions any way you want. Just mix and match the tools above to accomplish this. Also check out the documentation on Authlogic::ActiveRecord::AuthenticatesMany.\n\n== Errors\n\nThe errors in Authlogic work JUST LIKE ActiveRecord. In fact, it uses the exact same ActiveRecord errors class. Use it the same way:\n\n  class UserSession\n    before_validation :check_if_awesome\n    \n    private\n      def check_if_awesome\n        errors.add(:login, \"must contain awesome\") if login && !login.include?(\"awesome\")\n        errors.add_to_base(\"You must be awesome to log in\") unless record.awesome?\n      end\n  end\n\n== Automatic Session Updating\n\nThis is one of my favorite features that I think is pretty cool. It's things like this that make a library great and let you know you are on the right track.\n\nJust to clear up any confusion, Authlogic stores both the record id and the persistence token in the session. Why? So stale sessions can not be persisted. It stores the id so it can quickly find the record, and the persistence token to ensure no sessions are stale. The persistence token changes with the password, if someone is logged in and their password is changed, they should be logged out, unless they made the change. That being said, the person making the change needs their session to be updated with the new persistence token, so they stay logged in, which is what this section is all about.\n\nSo what if a user changes their password? You have to re-log them in with the new password, recreate the session, etc. This is messy and leads to redundant code. Or what if a user creates a new user account? You have to do the same thing. Here's an even better one: what if a user is in the admin area and changes their own password? There might even be another place passwords can change. It shouldn't matter, your code should be written in a way where you don't have to remember to do this.\n\nInstead of updating sessions all over the place, doesn't it make sense to do this at a lower level? Like the User model? You're saying \"but Ben, models can't mess around with sessions and cookies\". True...but Authlogic can, and you can access Authlogic just like a model. I know in most situations it's not good practice to do this, but I view this in the same class as sweepers, and feel like it actually is good practice here. User sessions are directly tied to users, they should be connected on the model level.\n\nFear not, because the acts_as_authentic method you call in your model takes care of this for you, by adding an after_save callback to automatically keep the session up to date. You don't have to worry about it anymore. Don't even think about it. Let your UsersController deal with users, not users *AND* sessions. *ANYTIME* the user changes his password in *ANY* way, his session will be updated.\n\nHere is basically how this is done....\n\n  class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n    after_save :maintain_sessions!\n    \n    private\n      def maintain_sessions!\n        # If we aren't logged in and a user is created, log them in as that user\n        # If we aren't logged in and a user's password changes, log them in as that user\n        # If we are logged in and they change their password, update the session so they remain logged in\n      end\n  end\n\nObviously there is a little more to it than this, but hopefully this clarifies any confusion. Basically if you are *logged out* and you are changing passwords, Authlogic will log you in, since you already know the password for that account. Lastly, this can be altered / disabled via a configuration option. Just set :session_ids => nil when calling acts_as_authentic.\n\nWhen things come together like this I think its a sign that you are doing something right. Put that in your pipe and smoke it!\n\n== Testing\n\nTesting with authlogic is easy, there is a helper file that will add some convenient test helpers for you. In your test_helper.rb file do the following:\n\n  # test/test_helper.rb\n  require 'authlogic/testing/test_unit_helpers'\n\nYou get the following methods:\n\n  set_session_for(record_object)\n  set_cookie_for(record_object)\n  set_http_auth_for(username, password)\n\nIn your test, before you execute a request, just call one of those methods and it will set the proper values so that it will seem as if that record is logged in.\n\nYou can also checkout the authlogic_example application (see helpful links above), the tests there use this.\n\n== Framework agnostic (Rails, Merb, etc.)\n\nI designed Authlogic to be framework agnostic, meaning it doesn't care what framework you use it in. Right out of the box it supports rails and merb. I have not had the opportunity to use other frameworks, but the only thing stopping Authlogic from being used in other frameworks is a simple adapter. Check out controller_adapters/rails_adapter, or controller_adapters/merb_adapter.\n\nSince pretty much all of the frameworks in ruby follow the Rack standards, the code should be very similar across adapters. In fact that abstract adapter assumes you are following the Rack standards. If your framework is following the rack standards, there really isn't any code you should have to write. Check out the merb_adapter to see for yourself, the merb adapter is basically blank. You're saying \"but Ben, why not just hook into Rack and avoid the need for controller adapters all together?\". It's not that simple, because rails doesn't inherit from the Rack::Request class, plus there are small differences between how rack is implemented in each framework. Authlogic has to hook into your controller with a before_filter anyways, so it can \"activate\" itself. Why not just use the controller object? Also when we have access to the controller object we can do other nifty things. Checkout the OpenID tutorial in the helpful links section above to see what I mean.\n\nThe point in all of this rambling is that implementing Authlogic is as simple as creating an adapter. I created both the rails and merb adapters in under 10 minutes. If you have an adapter you created and would like to add please let me know and I will add it into the source.\n\n== How it works\n\nInterested in how all of this all works? Basically a before filter is automatically set in your controller which lets Authlogic know about the current controller object. This \"activates\" Authlogic and allows Authlogic to set sessions, cookies, login via basic http auth, etc. If you are using your framework in a multiple thread environment, don't worry. I kept that in mind and made this thread safe.\n\nFrom there it is pretty simple. When you try to create a new session the record is authenticated and then all of the session / cookie magic is done for you. The sky is the limit.\n\n== What's wrong with the current solutions?\n\nYou probably don't care, but I think releasing the millionth ruby authentication solution requires a little explanation.\n\nI don't necessarily think the current solutions are \"wrong\", nor am I saying Authlogic is the answer to your prayers. But, to me, the current solutions were lacking something. Here's what I came up with...\n\n=== Generators are messy\n\nGenerators have their place, and it is not to add authentication to an app. It doesn't make sense. Generators are meant to be a starting point for repetitive tasks that have no sustainable pattern. Take controllers, the set up is the same thing over and over, but they eventually evolve to a point where there is no clear cut pattern. Trying to extract a pattern out into a library would be extremely hard, messy, and overly complicated. As a result, generators make sense here.\n\nAuthentication is a one time set up process for your app. It's the same thing over and over and the pattern never really changes. The only time it changes is to conform with newer / stricter security techniques. This is exactly why generators should not be an authentication solution. Generators add code to your application, once code crosses that line, you are responsible for maintaining it. You get to make sure it stays up with the latest and greatest security techniques. And when the plugin you used releases some major update, you can't just re-run the generator, you get to sift through the code to see what changed. You don't really have a choice either, because you can't ignore security updates.\n\nUsing a library that hundreds of other people use has it advantages. Probably one of the biggest advantages if that you get to benefit from other people using the same code. When Bob in California figures out a new awesome security technique and adds it into Authlogic, you get to benefit from that with a single update. The catch is that this benefit is limited to code that is not \"generated\" or added into your app. As I said above, once code is \"generated\" and added into your app, it's your responsibility.\n\nLastly, there is a pattern here, why clutter up all of your applications with the same code over and over?\n\n=== Security gets outdated\n\nJust as I stated in the above section, you can't stay up to date with your security since the code is generated and updating the plugin does nothing. If there is one thing you should stay up to date with, it's security. But it's not just the fact that there is no reasonable method for receiving updates. It's the fact that they tie you down to an encryption algorithm *AND* they use a bad one at that. Every single solution I've seen uses Sha1, which is joining the party with MD5. Sha1 is not as secure as it used to be. But that's the nature of algorithms, they eventually get phased out, which is fine. Everyone knows this, why not accommodate for this? Authlogic does this with the :transition_from_crypto_provider option. It takes care of transitioning all of your users to a new algorithm. Even better, it provides BCrypt as an option which should, in theory, never require you to switch since you can adjust the cost and make the encryption stronger. At the same time, still compatible with older passwords using the lower cost.\n\n=== Why test the same code over and over?\n\nI've noticed my apps get cluttered with authentication tests, and they are the same exact tests! This irritates me. When you have identical tests across your apps thats a red flag that code can be extracted into a library. What's great about Authlogic is that I tested it for you. You don't write tests that test the internals of ActiveRecord do you? The same applies for Authlogic. Only test code that you've written. Essentially testing authentication is similar to testing any another RESTful controller. This makes your tests focused and easier to understand.\n\n=== Limited to a single authentication\n\nI recently had an app where you could log in as a user and also log in as an employee. I won't go into the specifics of the app, but it made the most sense to do it this way. So I had two sessions in one app. None of the current solutions I found easily supported this. They all assumed a single session. One session was messy enough, adding another just put me over the edge and eventually forced me to write Authlogic. Authlogic can support 100 different sessions easily and in a clean format. Just like an app can support 100 different models and 100 different records of each model.\n\n=== Too presumptuous\n\nA lot of them forced me to name my password column as \"this\", or the key of my cookie had to be \"this\". They were a little too presumptuous. I am probably overly picky, but little details like that should be configurable. This also made it very hard to implement into an existing app.\n\n=== Disclaimer\n\nI am not trying to  \"bash\" any other authentication solutions. These are just my opinions, formulate your own opinion. I released Authlogic because I was \"scratching my own itch\".

abstractor for Rails","readme":"= make_resourceful\n===== Take back control of your Controllers. Make them awesome. Make them sleek. Make them resourceful.\n\nREST is a fine pattern for designing controllers,\nbut it can be pretty repetitive.\nWho wants to write out the same actions and copy the same model lookup logic\nall over their application?\n\nmake_resourceful handles all that for you.\nIt sets up all your RESTful actions and responses with next to no code.\nEverything has full, sensible default functionality.\n\nOf course, no controller _only_ uses the defaults.\nSo make_resourceful can be massively customized,\nwhile still keeping your controllers trim and readable.\n\n== Get it!\n \nRails\n\n  $ ruby script/plugin install http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk\n  $ mv vendor/plugins/trunk vendor/plugins/make_resourceful\n\nSubversion\n\n  $ svn co http://svn.hamptoncatlin.com/make_resourceful/trunk make_resourceful\n\n== Use it!\n\nThe easiest way to start with make_resourceful\nis to run the resource_scaffold generator.\nIt uses the same syntax as the Rails scaffold_resource generator:\n\n  $ script/generate resource_scaffold post title:string body:text\n\nIt does, however, require Haml[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com].\nYou _are_ using Haml, right? No?\nI'll wait here while you go fall in love with it.\n\nIf you want to try make_resourceful on one of your current controllers,\njust replace the mess of repetition with this:\n\n  class FooController < ApplicationController\n    make_resourceful do\n      actions :all\n    end\n  end\n\nThose three lines will replace the entire default controller\nthat comes out of the scaffold_resource generator.\n\n=== Really?\n\nYes.\n\n=== Can I do nested resources?\n\n  make_resourceful do\n    actions :all\n    belongs_to :post\n  end\n\n=== What if I want to use fancy permalinks?\n\n  def current_object\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_permalink(params[:id])\n  end\n\n=== What about paging?\n\n  def current_objects\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find(:all,\n      :order => \"created_at DESC\", :page => {:current => params[:page], :size => 10 } )\n  end\n\n=== What if I want to do something in the middle of an action?\n\n  before :show, :index do\n    @page_title = \"Awesome!\"\n  end\n\n  after :create_fails do\n    @page_title = \"Not So Awesome!\"\n  end\n\n=== What about all of my awesome respond_to blocks for my XML APIs and RJS responses?\n\n  response_for :show do |format|\n    format.html\n    format.js\n    format.xml\n  end\n\n  response_for :update_fails do |format|\n    format.html { render :action => 'edit' }\n    format.json { render :json => false.to_json, :status => 422 }\n  end\n\n=== So I guess I have to write responses for all my actions?\n\nNope! make_resourceful makes them do the right thing by default.\nYou only need to customize them if you want to do something special.\n\n=== Seriously?!\n\nYes!\n\n== Grok it!\n\n=== +make_resourceful+ the Method\n\nThe +make_resourceful+ block is where most of the action happens.\nHere you specify which actions you want to auto-generate,\nwhat code you want to run for given callbacks,\nand so forth.\n\nYou also use the block to declare various bits of information about your controller.\nFor instance, if the controller is nested, you'd call +belongs_to+.\nIf you wanted to expose your models as some sort of text format,\nyou'd call +publish+.\n\nCheck out the documentation of Resourceful::Builder\nfor more information on the methods you can call here.\n\n=== Helper Methods\n\nmake_resourceful provides lots of useful methods\nthat can be used in your callbacks and in your views.\nThey range from accessing the records you're looking up\nto easily generating URLs for a record\nto getting information about the action itself.\n\nTwo of the most useful methods are +current_object+ and +current_objects+\n(note the subtle plurality difference).\n+current_objects+ only works for +index+,\nand returns all the records in the current model.\n+current_object+ works for all actions other than +index+,\nand returns the record that's currently being dealt with.\n\nThe full documentation of the helper methods\nis in Resourceful::Default::Accessors and Resourceful::Default::URLs.\n\n=== Nested Resources\n\nmake_resourceful supports easy management of nested resources.\nThis is set up with the Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to declaration.\nPass in the name of the parent model,\n\n  belongs_to :user\n\nand everything will be taken care of.\nWhen +index+ is run for GET /users/12/albums,\nparent_object[link:classes/Resourceful/Accessors.html#M000024]\nwill get <tt>User.find(params[:user_id])</tt>,\nand current_objects[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000010]\nwill get <tt>parent_object.albums</tt>.\nWhen +create+ is run for POST /users/12/albums,\nthe newly created Album will automatically belong to the user\nwith id 12.\n\nThe normal non-scoped actions still work, too.\nGET /albums/15 runs just fine.\nmake_resourceful knows that since there's no <tt>params[:user_id]</tt>,\nyou just want to deal with the album.\n\nYou can even have a single resource nested under several different resources.\nJust pass multiple parent names to the Resourceful::Builder#belongs_to, like\n\n  belongs_to :user, :artist\n\nThen /users/15/albums and /artists/7/albums will both work.\n\nThis does, however, mean that make_resourceful only supports one level of nesting.\nThere's no automatic handling of /users/15/collections/437/albums.\nHowever, this is really the best way to organize most resources anyway;\nsee this article[http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources].\n\nIf you really need a deeply nested controller,\nit should be easy enough to set up on your own.\nJust override current_model[link:classes/Resourceful/Default/Accessors.html#M000018].\nSee the next section for more details.\n\n=== Overriding Methods\n\nNot only are helper methods useful to the developer to use,\nthey're used internally by the actions created by make_resourceful.\nThus one of the main ways make_resourceful can be customized\nis by overriding accessors.\n\nFor instance, if you want to only look up the 10 most recent records for +index+,\nyou're override +current_objects+.\nIf you wanted to use a different model than that suggested by the name of the controller,\nyou'd override +current_model+.\n\nWhen you're overriding methods that do SQL lookups, though, be a little cautious.\nBy default, these methods cache their values in instance variables\nso that multiple SQL queries aren't run on multiple calls.\nWhen overriding them, it's wise for you to do the same.\nFor instance,\n\n  def current_object\n    @current_object ||= current_model.find_by_name(params[:name])\n  end\n\n=== For More Information...\n\nHaven't found all the information you need in the RDoc?\nStill a little confused about something?\nDon't despair, there are still more resources available!\n\n* Nathan Weizenbaum periodically makes blog posts about new features and versions of make_resourceful.\n  They may be a little outdated, but they should still be useful and explanatory.\n  * On nesting and associations: here[http://nex-3.com/posts/55-nesting-and-make_resourceful].\n  * An overview of make_resourceful 0.2.0 and 0.2.2: here[http://localhost:3000/posts/54-make_resourceful-0-2-0].\n  *

I don't even know if it works anymore. At least it may help someone learn something.**\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license agreement. This means you can copy, redistribute, change, sell, whatever your want, as long as you keep the permission notice and its copyright information. See the [full text of the license][1] for details.\r\n\r\n=== INSTALATION ===\r\n\r\nTo use this plugin in your project, it should be declared as a component on your controller.\r\nYou can declare it inside your controller like this:\r\n\r\n    var $components = array('Postit.Postit');\r\n\r\nIf you want this component in ALL your controllers, just add the code above to your app_controller.php\r\n\r\nYou can access this components through $this->Postit inside your controller.\r\n\r\n=== USAGE ===\r\n\r\nTo use this plugin, you should call $this->Postit, passing all parameters as chained methods (see below).\r\nYou ALWAYS need to call upload() method last. If you do not call it, nothing will happen.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    $this->Postit->image(\"avatar\")->size(\"160x320\")->save_to(\"avatars\")->upload();\r\n\r\nAll parameters are called after $this->Postit, and separated by the arrow ->\r\n\r\nThe only parameters not optional are IMAGE() and UPLOAD().\r\n\r\nIf a param has an alias, you can call its alias instead of the real name. You can see below that image() param \r\nhas an alias called picture. So you can call it image() or picture() and the result is the same.\r\n\r\nSee below all parameters available and their aliases.\r\n\r\n=== SPECIAL NOTE: MAXIMIZATION ===\r\n\r\nBoth main picture and thumbnail have their 'maximization' variable set to false. What does it mean?\r\n\r\nIf you set the desired size (lets say '300x300') and you have an image with size 400x270, then its width \r\nwill be reduced to 300, and its height WILL STAY 270. Why does it happen? Maximization!\r\n\r\nWhen you set image size, you are telling the plugin what's the biggest size you want. If width or height of \r\nthe image is SMALLER then the size you passed, it will not change if maximization if OFF (set to false).\r\n\r\nThere are params that set image maximization to ON (set to true). When it's on, and you informed a size bigger \r\nthan 0, than this size will always expand to the desired size. So, in the example aboxe, the picture width\r\nwill be reduced to 300, and its height will be expanded to 300.\r\n\r\nNever forget maximization when using this plugin.\r\n\r\n*** If you want your images ALWAYS maximized, you can use a maximize param in your beforeFilter, like this:\r\n\r\n    $this->Postit->maximize_both();\r\n\r\nAnd then the magic of maximization will always happen.\r\n\r\n=== PARAMETERS ===\r\n\r\nDefault parameters are located inside parentheses ( )\r\n\r\n-- Main Picture Parameters --\r\n\r\nThese parameters work on the main picture only, and does not affect thumbnail.\r\n\r\nimage('image') --> This param tells the plugin wich of the form fields holds image information. \r\n\r\nYou should pass the name of the input form your HTML form where the image was uploaded.\r\n\r\nAliases: picture\r\n\r\nsize('0x0') --> This param defines image width and height. It should be a string where width and height are \r\nseparated by an 'x'.\r\n\r\nIf width or height are 0, the original size is not changed. Example: ('0x300') will change the height, but the\r\nwidth will be intact.\r\n\r\nIf you want width OR height to be automatically resized to keep image scale, set it as -1 and the other dimension above 0.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n    size('395x-1')\r\n\r\nmaximize_picture() --> Activates maximization of the main picture. See chapter Maximization above.\r\n\r\nAliases: max_picture, max_pic\r\n\r\n-- Thumbnail Parameters --\r\n\r\nwith_thumbnail('0x0') --> The main thumbnail method. This is used to tell the system a thumbnail should be \r\ngenerated, and sets the size at the same time. This follows the same patter of widthxheight.\r\n\r\nSize is not mandatory. You can call this method with no size, and then call the smart methods width() and \r\nheight() to define size.\r\n\r\nIf no size is defined by any means (or defined as 0) then the original size of the image is not changed.\r\n\r\nAliases: thumb, with_thumb, copy\r\n\r\nmaximize_thumbnail() --> Activates maximization of the thumbnail. See chapter Maximization above.\r\n\r\nAliases: max_thumbnail, max_thumb\r\n\r\n-- Smart Parameters --\r\n\r\nSmart parameters are special. They can be applied to the main picture OR the thumbnail, but will not affect \r\nboth at the same time (exception: maximize_both()). The effect of the smart methods depends on the moment \r\nyou call then.\r\n\r\nIf you call a smart method after calling a main picture method, then it will work on the main picture.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\n    $this->Postit->image(\"avatar\")->to_folder(\"avatars\")->upload();\r\n\r\nIn this example, to_folder is being applied to the main picture\r\n\r\nIf you call a smart method after calling a thumbnail method, then it will work on the thumbnail.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    $this->Postit->image(\"avatar\")->with_thumbnail(\"90x90\")->to_folder(\"thumbs\")->upload();\r\n\r\nIn this example, to_folder is being applied to the thumbnail.\r\n\r\nmaximize() --> Activates image maximization. See chapter Maximization above.\r\n\r\nAliases: max.\r\n\r\nmaximize_both() --> Activates the main picture's AND thumbnail's maximization. See chapter Maximization above.\r\n\r\nAliases: max_both\r\n\r\nheight('0') --> Set the image height. If it was already set before, this new value overwrite the old one.\r\nAliases: h\r\n\r\nwidth('0') --> Set the image width. If it was already set before, this new value overwrite the old one.\r\nAliases: w\r\n\r\nto_folder('img/') --> Defines the folder the image is going to be saved at. It is not necessary to add img/ at the beginning, because the system does it for you.\r\n\r\nAliases: save_to, folder, dir\r\n\r\nname('imagename') --> Defines what the image file will be named after its been resized and moved.\r\n\r\nupload() --> This is the final method. It should be called last! This method gets all passed params and then \r\nhandles file upload, resizing, copying, moving and renaming. It is the magic method that makes everything \r\nhappen!\r\n\r\nAliases: send, up\r\n\r\n[1]:/mit-license.txt\r\n","language":[{"lang":"PHP","bytes":20621}],"repository":[{"path":"README.md","type":"Blob"},{"path":"controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"controllers/components","type":"Tree"},{"path":"controllers/components/postit.php","type":"Blob"},{"path":"mit-license.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tests","type":"Tree"},{"path":"tests/cases","type":"Tree"},{"path":"tests/cases/postit.test.php","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"contato@leonardobighi.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"contato@leonardobighi.com"},"message":"Added MIT License"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Fixing my own mistake"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Aplicando correções sugeridas pela Gabriela"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Salvando o trabalho antes de sair de ferias"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Bug fixes on the aliases"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Fixing another typo in README"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Fixing a typo in README"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Minor fixes, and added a README in english"},"author_login":"bighi","committer_login":"bighi"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Leonardo Bighi","email":"pspawn@gmail.com"},"message":"Now translated to english.

The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n","language":[{"lang":"","bytes":0}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"NOTES","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"TODO","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers/application.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/concepts_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/corporate_bodies_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/events_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/expressions_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/families_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/frbr_objects_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/items_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/manifestations_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/people_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/places_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/reifications_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/subjects_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/works_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/helpers/application_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/concepts_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/corporate_bodies_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/events_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/expressions_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/families_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/frbr_objects_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/items_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/manifestations_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/people_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/places_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/subjects_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/works_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/models/aboutness.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/concept.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/corporate_body.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/creation.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/event.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/expression.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/family.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/frbr_object.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/item.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/manifestation.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/ownership.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/person.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/place.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/production.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/realization.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/reification.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/work.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/concepts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/concepts/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/concepts/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/concepts/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/concepts/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/concepts/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/_attributes.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/corporate_bodies/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/events/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/_attributes.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/expressions/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/families/_attributes.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families/new.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/families/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/frbr_objects","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/frbr_objects/_form.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/frbr_objects/edit.html.erb","type":"Blo

module you intend to use for details\n\nmy $url = 'https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Shorten';\nmy $short_url = makeashorterlink($url);\nmy $long_url  = makealongerlink($short_url);\n\n\n# - OR -\n# If you don't like the long function names:\n\nuse WWW::Shorten 'TinyURL', ':short';\nmy $short_url = short_link($url);\nmy $long_url = long_link( $short_url );\n```\n\n# DESCRIPTION\n\nA Perl interface to various services that shorten URLs. These sites maintain\ndatabases of long URLs, each of which has a unique identifier.\n\n# DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThe following shorten services have been deprecated as the endpoints no longer\nexist or function:\n\n- WWW::Shorten::LinkToolbot\n- WWW::Shorten::Linkz\n- WWW::Shorten::MakeAShorterLink\n- WWW::Shorten::Metamark\n- WWW::Shorten::TinyClick\n- WWW::Shorten::Tinylink\n- WWW::Shorten::Qurl\n- WWW::Shorten::Qwer\n\nWhen version 3.100 is released, these deprecated services will not be part of\nthe distribution.\n\n# SHORTEN APP\n\nA very simple program called `shorten` is supplied in the\ndistribution's `bin` folder. This program takes a URL and\ngives you a shortened version of it.\n\n# ISSUES OR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nPlease submit any [issues](https://github.com/p5-shorten/www-shorten/issues) you\nmight have.  We appreciate all help, suggestions, noted problems, and especially patches.\n\n*  If you know of a shorten service that we don't already have, make your own\nservice and release it as a separate module, like\n[WWW::Shorten::Googl](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Shorten::Googl) or [WWW::Shorten::Bitly](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Shorten::Bitly).\nAlternatively, you can let us know and we'll be happy to work it up for you.\n\n# AUTHOR\n\nIain Truskett spoon@cpan.org\n\n# CONTRIBUTORS\n\n- Alex Page -- for the original LWP hacking on which Dave based his code.\n- Ask Bjoern Hansen --

from svn","readme":"merb_geokit\n===========\n\nA plugin for the Merb framework that provides the geokit rails plugin.\nThis is mostly just a port of the rails plugin to merb format.  You should\nsee the documentation on the geokit project for more instructions.\n\nsite: http://geokit.rubyforge.org/\nrdoc: http://geokit.rubyforge.org/api/index.html\n\n\nusing with merb\n===============\n\nInstall with\n# svn co http://merb-geokit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ merb_geokit\n# cd merb_geokit\n# rake package\n# gem install pkg/merb_geokit-x.x.x.gem\n\nInclude it in Merb in your dependencies.rb file in the config dir\ndependency \"merb_geokit\"\n\nWhen you first startup merb it will copy a default geokit.rb file\nto your config directory.  You should edit that file and add your API\nkeys to it.\n\n\ngeocoding\n=========\nThis plugin comes with several geocoding interfaces.  You will need to sign\nup for an API key for at least Google and Yahoo.\n\nGeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)\nGeoKit::Geocoders::YahooGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)\nGeoKit::Geocoders::UsGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)\nGeoKit::Geocoders::CaGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)\nGeoKit::Geocoders::IpGeocoder.geocode(someaddress)\n\neg:\n\n>> address = \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC\"\n=> \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC\"\n>> puts GeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode(address).to_yaml\n--- !ruby/object:GeoKit::GeoLoc \ncity: Washington\ncountry_code: US\nfull_address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006, USA\nlat: 38.898774\nlng: -77.036655\nprecision: address\nprovider: google\nstate: DC\nstreet_address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave Nw\nsuccess: true\nzip: \"20006\"\n=> nil\n\nsession/cookie location store\n=============================\n\nIf you want to store the geocode location of the user in a session\nor cookie, based on IP address, then add the following to the top of\nthe Application controller\n\nbefore :store_ip_location\n\nthen you will have:\n\nsession[:geo_location]\ncookies[:geo_location]\n\nacts_as_mappable\n================\n\nActs as mappable works with ActiveRecord objects and will allow you to\ndo work with locations.  This would take an address, city, and state\nand automatically look it up and populate the database with the results\nfrom the search, including the lat, lng, and zip.\n\nclass Location < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_mappable\n  validate :validate_address, :ensure_unique_address\n\n  private\n  def validate_address\n    address = \"#{self.address}, #{self.city}, #{self.state}\"\n    geo=GeoKit::Geocoders::YahooGeocoder.geocode(address)\n    unless geo.success && geo.street_address\n      errors.add(:address, \"Could not find address\") \n    end\n    if geo.success\n      self.lat, self.lng, self.zip = geo.lat,geo.lng,geo.zip\n      self.address, self.city, self.state = geo.street_address, geo.city, geo.state\n    end\n  end\n\n  def ensure_unique_address\n    unless Location.find_all_by_address_and_zip(self.address,self.zip).empty?\n      errors.add(:address, \"has already been taken\")\n    end\n  end\n\nend\n\n\nrake tasks\n==========\n\nThis plugin also adds rake tasks.  You must supply the address as an\nenvironmental variable.  \n\n$ rake -T geo\n\nrake geo:ip      # Lookup up the address of an IP\nrake geo:google  # Look up an address on google\nrake geo:yahoo   #

plugin for Rails applications that allows for custom tagging along dynamic contexts. Fork is to denormalize and optimize for speed (mainly for keeping lock times to a minimum)","readme":"is_taggable\n===============================================================================\n\nThis plugin is almost entirely based on acts-as-taggable-on by Michael Bleigh +\ncontributors.\n\nis_taggable supports the awesome contextual tagging of acts-as-taggable-on, but\nwith a couple substantial changes to the underlying architecture.\n\nArchitecture Differences\n===============================================================================\n\nWe had a couple key issues with the underlying architecture in \nacts-as-taggable-on which we felt deserved a forking into a new direction.\nThere are two main architectural differences between is_taggable and\nacts-as-taggable-on:\n\n1) is_taggable does *not* use a normalized data model -- there is one table\n\"taggings\" and not two tables \"taggings\" and \"tags\". This means that tags are\nduplicated in the taggings table. The reason behind this was that we could not\nfind a reason justifying the join that couldn't be easily overcome with unique\nindexing and grouped selects.\n\n2) (This is the big one) -- is_taggable skips validations and callbacks on the\nTagging model when saving. This totally breaks the normal AR behavior and the\nbehavior used by all other AR tagging plugins. The reason for this is that the\ntaggings are updated with a multi-insert -- which also means this plugin can \nonly be used on databases which support multi-insert (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle,\n...). The reason we use a multi-insert is because we ran into massive problems\nwith large numbers of writes on taggings. Take this scenario:\n\nI upload a photo and fill in my tags when I upload it. I want people to find it\nso I tag it with about 20 different keywords. In order to save the tags on my\nphoto the original plugin would have to (at least):\n\n2) do 20 SELECTs on the taggings table for validates_uniqueness_of\n4) do some number (at most 20) of INSERTs on the tags table to save the tags\n3) do 20 INSERTs on the taggings table to save the taggings\n\nSo best case 20 INSERTs, 20 SELECTs -- worst case 40 INSERTs, 20 SELECTs.\n\nNow get a few users adding lots of tags on things concurrently and you can see\nwrites quickly becoming a problem, and as the number of tags I'm adding grows,\nthe problem gets worse. Individual INSERTs are fast, but once you have\nconcurrency you have lock waits and the the problem gets massively compounded.\n\nBy using a multi-insert, a non-normalized table, and a \"manual\" validation (do\nall the validates_uniqueness_of checks at once) we can get it down to:\n\n2) do 1 SELECT to check for duplicated taggings\n3) do 1 multi-INSERT to INSERT all the taggings\n\nFurthermore, no matter how many tags your inserting, it's always 1 SELECT and 1\nINSERT.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the impact of updating tags. In the original \nplugin this was done as a loop causing multiple DELETEs followed by multiple\nINSERTs. We've taken this down to 1 DELETE followed by 1 multi-INSERT.\n\nCompatibility\n===============================================================================\n\nis_taggable requires that your underlying database support multi-INSERT\nstatements (i.e. INSERT INTO taggings (tag) VALUES ('foo', 'bar', 'baz')). Most\n\"major\" databases do -- including MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.\n\nIt has only been tested with Rails 2.1+ and makes use of named_scope (introduced\nin Rails 2.1).\n\nInstallation\n===============================================================================\n\nGemPlugin\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRails 2.1+ introduces gem dependencies, to use them add this line to \nenvironment.rb:\n  \n  config.gem \"citrusbyte-is_taggable\", :source => \"http://gems.github.com\", :lib => \"is_taggable\"\n  \nThen run \"rake gems:install\" to install the gem.\n\nPlugin\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  script/plugin install git://github.com/citrusbyte/is_taggable.git\n  \nGem\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  gem install citrusbyte-is_taggable --source http://gems.github.com\n\nPost Installation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. script/generate is_taggable_migration\n2. rake db/migrate\n\nTesting\n===============================================================================\n\nis_taggable uses RSpec for its test coverage, if you're using RSpec type:\n\nrake spec:plugins\n\nExamples (all stolen from acts-as-taggable-on docs)\n===============================================================================\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  is_taggable :tags, :skills, :interests\nend\n\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.tag_list = \"awesome, slick, hefty\"      # this should be familiar\n@user.skill_list = \"joking, clowning, boxing\" # but you can do it for any context!\n@user.skill_list # => [\"joking\",\"clowning\",\"boxing\"] as TagList\n@user.save\n\n@user.tags # => [<Tag name:\"awesome\">,<Tag name:\"slick\">,<Tag name:\"hefty\">]\n@user.skills # => [<Tag name:\"joking\">,<Tag name:\"clowning\">,<Tag name:\"boxing\">]\n\n# The old way\nUser.find_tagged_with(\"awesome\", :on => :tags) # => [@user]\nUser.find_tagged_with(\"awesome\", :on => :skills) # => []\n\n# The better way (utilizes named_scope)\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\", :on => :tags) # => [@user]\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\", :on => :skills) # => []\n\n@frankie = User.create(:name => \"Frankie\", :skill_list => \"joking, flying, eating\")\nUser.skill_counts # => [<Tag name=\"joking\" count=2>,<Tag name=\"clowning\" count=1>...]\n@frankie.skill_counts\n\nFinding Tagged Objects\n======================\n\nis_taggable utilizes Rails 2.1's named_scope to create an association\nfor tags. This way you can mix and match to filter down your results, and it\nalso improves compatibility with the will_paginate gem:\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  is_taggable :tags\n  named_scope :by_join_date, :order => \"created_at DESC\"\nend\n\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\").by_date\nUser.tagged_with(\"awesome\").by_date.paginate(:page => params[:page], :per_page => 20)\n\nRelationships\n=============\n\nYou can find objects of the same type based on similar tags on certain contexts.\nAlso, objects will be returned in descending order based on the total number of \nmatched tags.\n\n@bobby = User.find_by_name(\"Bobby\")\n@bobby.skill_list # => [\"jogging\", \"diving\"]\n\n@frankie = User.find_by_name(\"Frankie\")\n@frankie.skill_list # => [\"hacking\"]\n\n@tom = User.find_by_name(\"Tom\")\n@tom.skill_list # => [\"hacking\", \"jogging\", \"diving\"]\n\n@tom.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Bobby\">,<User name=\"Frankie\">]\n@bobby.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Tom\">] \n@frankie.find_related_skills # => [<User name=\"Tom\">] \n\n\nDynamic Tag Contexts\n====================\n\nIn addition to the generated tag contexts in the definition, it is also possible\nto allow for dynamic tag contexts (this could be user generated tag contexts!)\n\n@user = User.new(:name => \"Bobby\")\n@user.set_tag_list_on(:customs, \"same, as, tag, list\")\n@user.tag_list_on(:customs) # => [\"same\",\"as\",\"tag\",\"list\"]\n@user.save\n@user.tags_on(:customs) # => [<Tag name='same'>,...]\n@user.tag_counts_on(:customs)\nUser.find_tagged_with(\"same\", :on => :customs) # => [@user]\n\nTag Ownership\n=============\n\nTags can have owners:\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  is_tagger\nend\n\nclass Photo < ActiveRecord::Base\n  is_taggable :locations\nend\n\n@some_user.tag(@some_photo, :with => \"paris, normandy\", :on => :locations)\n@some_user.owned_taggings\n@some_user.owned_tags\n@some_photo.locations_from(@some_user)\n\nCaveats\n===============================================================================\n\n1) Your underlying database *must* support multi-INSERT\n2) You probably need Rails 2.1+, but seriously named_scope is so cool you need\n   it anyways.\n3) You cannot use callbacks/validations on the Tagging model (you can still use\n   them like normal on your Taggables and Taggers...)\n\nContributors\n===============================================================================\n\nis_taggable:\n* Ben Alavi & Michel Martens - Ruthless hackers of acts-as-taggable-on\n\nacts-as-taggable-on:\n* Michael Bleigh - Original Author\n* Brendan Lim - Related Objects\n* Pradeep Elankumaran - Taggers\n* Sinclair Bain - Patch King\n\nPatch Contributors\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nacts-as-taggable-on:\n* tristanzdunn - Related objects of other classes\n* azabaj - Fixed migrate down\n* Peter Cooper - named_scope fix\n* slainer68 - STI fix\n* harrylove - migration instructions and fix-ups\n* lawrencepit - cached tag work\n\nResources\n===============================================================================\n\n* GitHub     - http://github.com/citrusbyte/is_taggable\n* Lighthouse - http://citrusbyte.lighthouseapp.com/projects/\n\nis_taggable:\nCopyright (c) 2008 Citrusbyte, LLC, released under the MIT license\n\nacts-as-taggable-on:\nCopyright (c) 2007 Michael Bleigh (http://mbleigh.com/) and Intridea Inc.
