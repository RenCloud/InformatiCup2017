[{"id":92986,"name":"railsspace","full_name":"JonVisc/railsspace","owner_id":41317,"description":"Rails tutorial - Social Network site","readme":"== Welcome to Rails\n\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create \ndatabase-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern. \n\nThis pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into \"dumb\" templates\nthat are primarily responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags.\nThe model contains the \"smart\" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,\nPost) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to\na database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n","language":[{"lang":"","bytes":0}],"repository":[{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers/application.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/faq_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/profile_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/site_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/spec_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/user_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/helpers/application_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/faq_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/profile_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/site_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/spec_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/user_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/models/faq.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/user.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/faq","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/faq/_answer_text_area.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/faq/_sidebar_box.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/faq/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/faq/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/layouts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/layouts/application.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/profile","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/profile/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/profile/show.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/site","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/site/about.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/site/help.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/site/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/spec","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/spec/_field_row.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/spec/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/spec/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/user/_email_field_row.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/_password_field_row.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/_screen_name_field_row.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/edit.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/index.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/login.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user/register.html.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/boot.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/database.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environment.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/environments/development.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments/production.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/environments/test.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/initializers/inflections.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers/mime_types.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/initializers/new_rails_defaults.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/routes.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db","type":"Tree"},{"path":"db/migrate","type":"Tree"},{"path":"db/migrate/20080918165604_create_users.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20081204224316_create_sessions.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20081205151439_add_authorization_token.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20081205225105_create_specs.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/migrate/20081211130108_create_faqs.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"db/schema.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/README_FOR_APP","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/classes","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/ApplicationController.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/ApplicationHelper.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/SiteController.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/SiteHelper.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/User.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/UserController.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/classes/UserHelper.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/created.rid","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/controllers/application_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/controllers/site_controller_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/controllers/user_controller_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/helpers/application_helper_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/helpers/site_helper_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/helpers/user_helper_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/app/files/app/models/user_rb.html","type":"Blob"},{"pa

The idea is that it should be simple and straightforward, allowing\nyou to plug it in and get started quickly.\n\n\n## Why?\n\nYou would think config files would be a solved problem by now, but for some\nreason they're not. Java is still trying to shoehorn \"property files\" for\nthe purpose (keys and values are strings, no blocks). Python is still trying\nto use INI files (!), and Ruby invented a new text marshalling format (YAML)\nand decided to abuse that for config files too. It's all kind of a sad mess.\n\nConfiguration doesn't have to be a hard problem. My experience shows that\nonly a few features are needed:\n\n- key/value pairs can be set\n- values can be bools, ints, strings, or lists of strings\n- sets of key/value pairs can be grouped into blocks and nested\n  inside each other\n- some blocks can inherit default values from other blocks\n- values can be based (in some way) on previous values\n- files can be \"imported\" into each other\n\nFrom the API side, it should be easy to find and manage key/value pairs\nand blocks. A library should also be able to \"subscribe\" to a block and\nbe notified when values have been changed from somewhere else.\n\nNone of property files, INI files, or YAML files can do this. So here we\nare.\n\nAt Danger, after several false starts, we ended up with a server config\nfile format very much like what I've implemented here (but it was more\ncomplex and had a few major flaws). Other projects have created similar\nformats. So I think this is an idea whose time has come.\n\nLogging is tightly integrated with configuration, since config files are\nusually used to setup logging, and some sort of logging is usually required at\nthe same time as a config file. So this library puts them together,\nusing the simple config format to setup logging, too -- allowing most of the\nflexibility of java logging, but making it easy to do the common case of\ncreating a single logfile with one debug level.\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThis is all you need to know to use the library:\n\n    import net.lag.configgy.Configgy\n    import net.lag.logging.Logger\n\n    // load our config file and configure logfiles:\n    Configgy.configure(\"/etc/pingd.conf\")\n    \n    // read hostname and port:\n    val config = Configgy.config\n    val hostname = config.get(\"hostname\", \"localhost\")\n    val port = config.getInt(\"port\", 3000)\n    \n    // log an error:\n    val log = Logger.get\n    log.error(\"Unable to listen on %s:%d!\", hostname, port)\n    \n    // or an exception:\n    try {\n        ...\n    } catch {\n        case e: IOException => log.error(e, \"IOException while doodling\")\n    }\n\nThe following config file will setup a logfile at debug level, that rolls\nevery night, and also sets a few simple config values:\n\n    <log>\n        filename = \"/var/log/pingd.log\"\n        roll = \"daily\"\n        level = \"debug\"\n    </log>\n    \n    hostname = \"pingd.example.com\"\n    port = 3000\n\nThe rest of this README just describes the config file format, the logging\noptions, and how to use the library in more detail.\n\n\n## Basic Use\n\n### Config Files\n\nThe config file format is simple and clean. It borrows from XML, but isn't\nXML. It has a few advanced features, but limits itself to representing a\nnested structure of key/value pairs. It is always in UTF-8. Key names are\nalways case-insensitive.\n\nValues are set like so:\n\n    server_name = \"pingd\"\n\nKey names follow the same rules as C (or Java or Python) symbols, except\nthey may also contain dashes (\"-\") if you like.\n\nString values are in quotes, and have the usual escape codes, like `\\r`.\n`\\xHH` and `\\uHHHH` also work.\n\nInt values don't need quotes, but are treated like strings and converted\nonly at the last minute.\n\nBoolean values are turned \"on\" or \"off\" (or \"true\" or \"false\", with an\noptional equal sign -- whatever makes you happy):\n\n    use_root_privs off\n    drink_milk = false\n\nString lists are just strings enclosed in brackets, separated by commas:\n\n    states = [\"California\", \"Tennessee\", \"Idaho\"]\n\nGroups of keys may be enclosed in an XML-like tag:\n\n    <pingd>\n        # set a high timeout for now.\n        timeout = 30\n    </pingd>\n\nNested values can be accessed from the API and from within the config file\nas if they were in C structs, using dotted-name notation. So the above config is the same as:\n\n    pingd.timeout = 30\n\n\n### Logging\n\nLogging is configured in a special `<log>` block. The main logging options\nare described below.\n\n- **`filename`** -\n  the file to write log entries into (optional)\n- **`level`** -\n  the lowest severity log entry that should be written to the\n  logfile (defaults to `INFO`) (described below)\n- **`console`** -\n  `true` (`on`) if logs should be written to the stderr\n  console\n- **`syslog_host`** -\n  hostname (or `hostname:port`) to send syslog formatted\n  log data to (optional)\n- **`syslog_server_name`** -\n  server name to attach to log messages when\n  sending to a syslog (optional)\n- **`roll`** -\n  when the logfile should be rolled (described below)\n\nLogging severities are:\n\n    Severity   Description\n    =========  ================\n    FATAL      the server is about to exit\n    CRITICAL   something happened that is so bad that someone should probably\n                 be paged\n    ERROR      an error occurred that may be limited in scope, but was\n                 user-visible\n    WARNING    a coder may want to be notified, but the error was probably not\n                 user-visible\n    INFO       normal informational logging\n    DEBUG      coder-level debugging information\n    TRACE      intensive debugging information\n\nLogfile rolling policies are:\n\n    Name     Description\n    =======  =================\n    never    always use the same logfile\n    hourly   roll to a new logfile at the top of every hour\n    daily    roll to a new logfile at midnight every night\n    sunday   roll to a new logfile at midnight between saturday and sunday,\n               once a week\n\nYou can omit a rolling policy, or use policy \"never\", to avoid rolling the\nlogfiles. For weekly logfile rolling, you may use any day of the week\n(\"monday\", \"tuesday\", etc), not just \"sunday\".\n\nWhen a logfile is rolled, the current logfile is renamed to have the date (and\nhour, if rolling hourly) attached, and a new one is started. So, for example,\n`test.log` may become `test-20080425.log`, and `test.log` will be\nreopened as a new file.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n    <log>\n        filename = \"test.log\"\n        level = \"warning\"\n        roll = \"tuesday\"\n    </log>\n\ncreates a logfile `test.log` that captures log entries only at warning,\nerror, critical, or fatal levels. It's rolled once a week, at midnight on\nTuesday morning.\n\nNone of `filename`, `console`, or `syslog_host` are mutually exclusive,\nso you can define any or all of those targets, to have log messages sent to\nany possible combination of places.\n\n\n## Advanced Features\n\nThere are a few features you may not use right away, but you'll usually\nstart wanting after the code matures a bit.\n\n\n### Config Files\n\nPreviously-set config values can be included in new ones by using variable\nsubstitution, with shell syntax. This also pulls in values from the\nenvironment:\n\n    server_home = \"$(HOME)/servers/pingd\"\n    pid_file = \"$(server_home)/pingd.pid\"\n\nFiles can be included/imported into each other:\n\n    include \"$(server_home)/config/local.conf\"\n\n(The context is preserved, so if you are inside a block, the imported file\nis injected inside that block too.) The default importer uses the local\nfilesystem. You can set your own importer to use other sources.\n\nTo set a value only if it hasn't been set earlier (possibly by an included\nfile), use shell syntax:\n\n    server_home ?= \"/opt/pingd\"\n\nCommon config blocks can be inherited by later blocks:\n\n    <daemon-base>\n        timeout = 15\n        chroot = \"/opt/magic\"\n    </daemon-base>\n    \n    <pingd inherit=\"daemon-base\">\n        timeout = 30\n    </ping>\n\nThe pingd block will use its own value of \"timeout\" (30), but will inherit\n\"chroot\" from daemon-base. That is, \"pingd.chroot\" will be \"/opt/magic\".\n\n\n### Logging\n\nThere are a handful of options to tune logging more directly:\n\n- **`utc`** -\n  `on` to log in UTC (previously known as GMT) time instead of local\n  time (default: off)\n- **`truncate`** -\n  number of characters to allow in a single log line before eliding with\n  \"...\" (default: 0 = never truncate)\n- **`truncate_stack_traces`** -\n  number of lines of a stack trace to show before eliding (default: 30)\n- **`syslog_use_iso_date_format`** -\n  set `off` to use old-style BSD date format in syslog messages\n  (default: on)\n- **`use_full_package_names`** -\n  set `on` to use full package names in log lines (\"net.lag.configgy\")\n  instead of the toplevel node (\"configgy\") (default: off)\n- **`append`** -\n  set `off` to create a new logfile each time the app starts (default:\n  on, meaning to append to any existing logfile)\n\nThe logging options are usually set on the root node of java's \"logging tree\",\nat \"\". You can set options or logging handlers at other nodes by putting them\nin config blocks inside `<log>`. For example:\n\n    <log>\n        filename = \"test.log\"\n        level = \"warning\"\n        utc = true\n        \n        <squelch_noisy>\n            node = \"com.example.libnoise\"\n            level = \"critical\"\n        </squelch_noisy>\n    </log>\n\nThe \"com.example.libnoise\" node will log at \"critical\" level (presumably to\nsilence a noisy library), while everything else will log at \"warning\" level.\nYou can put any of the logging options inside these blocks, including those\nfor logging to files or syslog nodes, so in this way you can create multiple\nlogfiles.\n\nThe extra options you can use in these inner blocks are:\n\n- **`node`** -\n  define the log node name (as a string)\n- **`use_parents`** -\n  whether to fall back to parent log-node configuration (java's \n  `setUseParentHandlers`) (default: on)\n\n\n### Usage from within scala\n\nYou can build the scaladocs with the ant rule:\n\n    $ ant docs\n\nThe main interface is `Configgy`, which can be used to load a config file\nand configure logging. The loaded config object is of type `Config` which is\njust a `ConfigMap` with methods added for handling subscriptions.\n\n\n### Basic Config\n\nUsually you will just want to set or get config values.\n\nGetting values can return an Option, or (if you provide a default value), a\ndirect String (or Int, or Boolean, etc):\n\n    scala> config.getString(\"name\")\n    res1: Option[String] = Some(Bender)\n    \n    scala> config(\"name\")\n    res2: String = Bender\n\n    scala> config(\"name\", \"Frank\")\n    res3: String = Bender\n\n    scala> config.getInt(\"age\", 16)   \n    res4: Int = 23\n\nSetting values is similar:\n\n    scala> config(\"name\") = \"Bender\"\n    scala> config(\"age\") = 23\n\nTo access a nested attribute, you can either use a dotted key like:\n\n    scala> config.getInt(\"pingd.port\")\n    res10: Option[Int] = Some(3000)\n\nOr you can access the intermediate `ConfigMap` object:\n\n    scala> config.getConfigMap(\"pingd\")\n    res1: Option[net.lag.configgy.ConfigMap] = Some({pingd: port=\"3000\" })\n\n    scala> config.getConfigMap(\"pingd\").get.getInt(\"port\")\n    res2: Option[Int] = Some(3000)\n\n\n### Subscription API\n\nSubscribing to an `AttributesMap` causes the subscriber to get called on\nevery change to that node. For monitored config nodes, changes happen in two\nphases: validate and commit.\n\nIn validation, you can verify that the new settings for this config node are\nreasonable and consistent, and if not, you can throw an exception to reject\nthe change.\n\nIf all subscribers successfully validate a change, the commit method is called\nto notify subscribers that the change was successful. If any subscriber\nrefuses to validate a change, the code that called `set` should be prepared\nto catch the validation exception.\n\n\n### Logging\n\nTo access a logger from within a class or object, you can usually just use:\n\n    import net.lag.logging.Logger\n    private val log = Logger.get\n\nThis creates a `Logger` object that uses the current class or object's\npackage name as the logging node, so class \"com.example.foo.Lamp\" will log to\nnode \"com.example.foo\" (generally showing \"foo\" as the name in the logfile).\nYou can also get a logger explicitly by name:\n\n    private val log = Logger.get(\"com.example.foo\")\n\nLogger objects wrap everything useful from \"java.util.logging.Logger\", as well\nas adding some convenience methods:\n\n    // log a string with sprintf conversion:\n    log.info(\"Starting compaction on level %d...\", level)\n    \n    try {\n        ...\n    } catch {\n        // log an exception backtrace with the message:\n        case x: IOException => log.info(x, \"I/O exception: %s\", x.getMessage)\n    }\n\nEach of the log levels (from \"fatal\" to \"trace\") has these two convenience\nmethods. You may also use `log` directly:\n\n    log(Logger.DEBUG, \"Logging %s at debug level.\", name)\n\nAn advantage to using sprintf (\"%s\", etc) conversion, as opposed to:\n\n    log(Logger.DEBUG, \"Logging \" + name + \" at debug level.\")\n\nis that java & scala perform string concatenation at runtime, even if nothing\nwill be logged because the logfile isn't writing debug messages right now.\nWith sprintf parameters, the arguments are just bundled up and passed directly\nto the logging level before formatting. If no log message would be written to\nany file or device, then no formatting is done and the arguments are thrown\naway. That makes it very inexpensive to include excessive debug logging which\ncan be turned off without recompiling and re-deploying.\n\nThe logging classes are done as an extension to the `java.util.logging` API,\nand so if you want to use the java interface directly, you can. Each of the\njava classes (Logger, Handler, Formatter) is just wrapped by a scala class\nwith a cleaner interface.\n\n\n### Contact\n\nConfiggy was written by Robey Pointer <robeypointer@gmail.com> and is licensed\nunder the ISC license (included).

easy and fun Continuous Integration server","readme":"Integrity\n=========\n\nIntegrity is your friendly automated Continuous Integration server.\n\nIt's fully usable from within its web interface (backed by [Sinatra][]),\nallowing you to add a project, set preferences for it (where's the code\nrepository, is it completely private or public, etc), and run the build command\nfrom there.\n\nIt has been designed with ruby projects in mind, but any project that can be\ntested in an unix-y fashion (with a command line tool that returns 0 on success\nand non-zero on failure) works with it.\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\nInstall the `integrity` gem from GitHub:\n\n    gem sources --add http://gems.github.com\n    sudo gem install foca-integrity\n\nIn order to setup Integrity, run the following command:\n\n    integrity install /path/to/my/app\n\nThen browse to /path/to/my/app and edit the config files at your convenience.\nThe default configuration should be \"good enough\" in most cases, so you should\nbe pretty much ready to rock.\n\nFor deployment, we recommend [Thin][]. Provided with Integrity comes a thin.yml\nfile, so all you need to do after running `integrity install` should be\n\n    thin -C /path/to/my/app/thin.yml -R /path/to/my/app/config.ru start\n\nAnd you should be up and running.\n\nIf you want automatic commit processing, you currently need to be using\n[GitHub][]. Click the edit link on your GitHub project, and add an integrity\nlink that looks like the following to the `Post-Receive URL` field:\n\n    http://integrity.domain.tld/projectname/push\n\nReceiving Notifications\n=======================\n\nIf you want to be notified after each build, you need to install our notifiers.\nFor example, in order to receive an email after each build, install:\n\n    sudo gem install foca-integrity-email\n\nAnd then edit `/path/to/my/app/config.ru` and add:\n\n    require \"notifier/email\"\n\nAfter all the `require` lines.\n\nAvailable notifiers\n-------------------\n\n* [Mail](http://github.com/foca/integrity-email)\n* [Jabber](http://github.com/ph/integrity-jabber)\n* [Campfire](http://github.com/defunkt/integrity-campfire)\n\nResources\n========\n\nWe have a [Lighthouse account][lighthouse] where you can submit patches or\nfeature requests. Also, someone is usually around [#integrity][irc-channel] on\nFreenode, so don't hesitate to stop by for ideas, help, patches or something.\n\nFuture plans\n============\n\n* [Twitter][]/[IRC][]/etc bots\n* A sample generic post-receive-hook so you can run this from any git repo\n* Better integration with GitHub\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nThe code is stored in [GitHub][repo]. Feel free to fork, play with it, and send\na pull request afterwards. \n\nIn order to run the test suite you'll need a few more gems: [rspec][], [rcov][]\nand [hpricot][]. With that installed running `rake` will run the specs and\nensure the code coverage stays high.\n\nThanks\n======\n\nThanks to the fellowing people for their feedbacks, ideas and patches :\n\n* [James

library from ActiveWarehouse","readme":"Ruby Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool.\n\n== Requirements\n\n* Ruby 1.8.5 or higher\n* Rubygems\n\n== Online Documentation\n\nAvailable at http://activewarehouse.rubyforge.org/docs/activewarehouse-etl.html\n\n== Features\n\nCurrent supported features:\n\n* ETL Domain Specific Language (DSL) - Control files are specified in a Ruby-based DSL\n* Multiple source types. Current supported types:\n  * Fixed-width and delimited text files\n  * XML files through SAX\n  * Apache combined log format\n* Multiple destination types - file and database destinations\n* Support for extracting from multiple sources in a single job\n* Support for writing to multiple destinations in a single job\n* A variety of built-in transformations are included:\n  * Date-to-string, string-to-date, string-to-datetime, string-to-timestamp\n  * Type transformation supporting strings, integers, floats and big decimals\n  * Trim\n  * SHA-1\n  * Decode from an external decode file\n  * Default replacement for empty values\n  * Ordinalize\n  * Hierarchy lookup\n  * Foreign key lookup\n  * Ruby blocks\n  * Any custom transformation class\n* A variety of build-in row-level processors\n  * Check exists processor to determine if the record already exists in the destination database\n  * Check unique processor to determine whether a matching record was processed during this job execution\n  * Copy field\n  * Rename field\n  * Hierarchy exploder which takes a tree structure defined through a parent id and explodes it into a hierarchy bridge table\n  * Surrogate key generator including support for looking up the last surrogate key from the target table using a custom query\n  * Sequence generator including support for context-sensitive sequences where the context can be defined as a combination of fields from the source data\n  * New row-level processors can easily be defined and applied\n* Pre-processing\n  * Truncate processor\n* Post-processing\n  * Bulk import using native RDBMS bulk loader tools\n* Virtual fields - Add a field to the destination data which doesn't exist in the source data\n* Built in job and record meta data\n* Support for type 1 and type 2 slowly changing dimensions\n  * Automated effective date and end date time stamping for type 2\n  * CRC checking\n\n== Dependencies\nActiveWarehouse ETL depends on the following gems:\n* ActiveSupport Gem\n* ActiveRecord Gem\n* FasterCSV Gem\n* AdapterExtensions Gem\n\n== Usage\nOnce the ActiveWarehouse ETL gem is installed jobs can be invoked using the\nincluded `etl` script. The etl script includes several command line options\nand can process multiple control files at a time.\n\nCommand line options:\n* <tt>--help, -h</tt>: Display the usage message.\n* <tt>--config, -c</tt>: Specify a database.yml configuration file to use.\n* <tt>--limit, -l</tt>: Specify a limit to the number of rows to process. This option is currently only applicable to database sources.\n* <tt>--offset, -o</tt>: Specify the start offset for reading from the source. This option is currently only applicable to database sources.\n* <tt>--newlog, -n</tt>: Instruct the engine to create a new ETL log rather than append to the last ETL log.\n* <tt>--skip-bulk-import, -s</tt>: Skip any bulk imports.\n* <tt>--read-locally</tt>: Read from the local cache (skip source extraction)\n\n== Control File Examples\nControl file examples can be found in the examples directory.\n\n== Running Tests\nThe tests require Shoulda 1.x.\n\n== Feedback\nThis is a work in progress.

article on Ruby Advent 2008","readme":"In this installment of the Ruby Advent Calendar 2008, I'll show you\nhow easy it is to use JRuby to mix and match both Ruby and Java tools\nto quickly create a simple memory monitoring program.\n\nWe'll be using the venerable [Gruff graphing library][1], along with\n[RMagick4J][2], a Java port of the ImageMagick/RMagick imaging library\nfor JRuby, and the [jmx gem][3] as a nice Ruby wrapper around Java's\nJMX (Java Management Extensions) apis.\n\nIf you already have a JRuby installation you'd like to use to play\naround with the code for this article, you can install the gems we\nneed as follows:\n\n    jruby -S gem install gruff rmagick4j jmx\n\n(If you haven't played with JRuby before or don't have an install\nhandy, a [bundle is available][4] of the code for this\narticle, including JRuby and all dependencies.)\n\n## Gruff and RMagick4J\n\nFirst, let's look at getting Gruff working with RMagick4J. Though\nRMagick4J is, as of this writing, an incomplete port of ImageMagick\nand RMagick, it runs well enough to support Gruff. And that's a pretty\nreasonable trade-off, considering how easy it is to install RMagick4J\ninto JRuby (above) compared to the\n[process of setting up RMagick in MatzRuby][5].\n\n    require 'rubygems'\n    gem 'rmagick4j'\n    gem 'gruff'\n    require 'gruff'\n\n    g = Gruff::Line.new(\"400x300\")\n    g.title = \"My Graph\"\n\n    g.data(\"Apples\", [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3])\n    g.data(\"Oranges\", [4, 8, 7, 9, 8, 9])\n    g.data(\"Watermelon\", [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 8])\n    g.data(\"Peaches\", [9, 9, 10, 8, 7, 9])\n    g.labels = {0 => '2003', 2 => '2004', 4 => '2005'}\n\n    g.write('my_fruity_graph.png')\n\nHowever, since JRuby runs on Java, which sports the\nplatform-independent Swing GUI toolkit, we can also create a frame to\ndisplay the Gruff image rather than writing it to disk. Instead of\n`g.write('my_fruity_graph.png')` try this:\n\n    include Java\n    import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream\n    import javax.imageio.ImageIO\n    import javax.swing.JFrame\n\n    class ImagePanel < javax.swing.JPanel\n      def initialize(image, x=0, y=0)\n        super()\n        @image, @x, @y = image, x, y\n      end\n\n      def getPreferredSize\n        java.awt.Dimension.new(@image.width, @image.height)\n      end\n\n      def paintComponent(graphics)\n        graphics.draw_image(@image, @x, @y, nil)\n      end\n    end\n\n    image = ImageIO.read(ByteArrayInputStream.new(g.to_blob.to_java_bytes))\n    frame = JFrame.new(\"My Graph\")\n    frame.set_bounds 0, 0, image.width + 20, image.height + 40\n    frame.add(ImagePanel.new(image, 10, 10))\n    frame.visible = true\n\nA few words about this code. First, `include Java` mixes in JRuby's\nJava integration features. The next three lines `import` Java classes\nas Ruby classes and stores them in constants named the same as the\nJava class name. (*Aside*: Be careful when using this technique with a\nJava class whose name clashes with a Ruby class of the same name.\nInstead, consider an alternate style such as `JFile = java.io.File`.)\n\n`ImagePanel` is a Ruby class that extends Swing's `JPanel`, a Java\nclass. Note that the `super()` invocation in `ImagePanel`'s\ninitializer is necessary due to Ruby's default behavior of passing all\nthe arguments to the superclass initializer, which, in this case, is a\nJava constructor that doesn't take any. `getPreferredSize` and\n`paintComponent` are expected overrides on `JPanel`, and we use them\nto size and paint an image in the panel.\n\nIn the last part of the code, we create a Java image object, pass it into\na new `ImagePanel`, pack the panel into a `JFrame`, and show the frame.\n`to_java_bytes` is a JRuby-specific method on Ruby's String class that\nconverts the string to a Java `byte[]`.\n\nIf you're following along, and all goes well, you should be seeing\nthis:\n\n![gruff-simple](http://img.skitch.com/20081215-1bid2e7e9erjxm4dr8tk5fra3u.jpg)\n\n## JMX\n\n[Java Management Extensions (JMX)][6] is a management and monitoring\nAPI and framework for Java. It allows you to query and manipulate a\nlarge number of system metrics and components (called \"MBeans\"), as\nwell as register your own. You can control these MBeans both from\nwithin a VM and via remote connections to other VMs. Some examples of\nthings you can do with JMX are: check memory usage, list threads and\ntheir status, gather garbage collection, class loading and compiler\nstatistics, or force a garbage collection cycle.\n\nTypical of Java APIs, JMX is pretty verbose, and has its share of\nenterprisey `Manager`s and `Factory`s. But thanks to\n[Tom Enebo's JMX gem][3], it's easy to get connected to JMX and\nretrieve useful information. Here's the code to print out the current\nheap memory usage of the JVM:\n\n    def in_mb(value)\n      format \"%0.2f MB\" % (value.to_f / (1024 * 1024))\n    end\n\n    server = JMX::MBeanServer.new\n    memory = server[\"java.lang:type=Memory\"]\n    heap = memory.heap_memory_usage.used\n    puts \"Size of Heap: #{in_mb(heap)}\"\n\nWhen you run this snippet with JRuby, you should see:\n\n    Size of Heap: 13.83 MB\n\nIt's especially nice to explore the JMX MBeans in an IRB session.\n\n    >> server.query_names.select {|b| b.to_s =~ /jruby/ }.each {|b| puts b.to_s }\n    org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=ClassCache\n    org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=Config\n    org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=ParserStats\n    org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=JITCompiler\n    => [#<Java::JavaxManagement::ObjectName:...]\n    >> b = server['org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=Config']\n    => #<JMX::MBeans::Org::Jruby::Management::Config:...>\n    >> b.version_string\n    => \"jruby 1.1.6RC1 (ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 114) (2008-12-03 rev 8263) [i386-java]\\n\"\n    >> b = server['org.jruby:type=Runtime,name=4469286,service=ParserStats']\n    => #<JMX::MBeans::Org::Jruby::Management::ParserStats:...>\n    >> b.total_parse_time\n    => 0.843191\n\nHere, we're exploring some of JRuby's own MBeans, and found out that\nthe time JRuby spent parsing source code since startup is a little\nunder a second.\n\n## Graphing the Memory in the VM\n\nNow, let's put all these tools together. Let's start with a class that\nsamples the memory every two seconds, and saves a rolling window of 50\nsamples.\n\n    class MemorySampler\n      def initialize(&block)\n        @samples = []\n        @keep = 50\n        @interval = 2\n        @callback = block\n        @server = JMX::MBeanServer.new\n        @memory_bean ||= @server[\"java.lang:type=Memory\"]\n      end\n  \n      def memory_usage\n        [@memory_bean.heap_memory_usage.used, \n         @memory_bean.non_heap_memory_usage.used]\n      end\n  \n      def samples\n        dat = @samples.dup.transpose\n        { \"Heap\" => dat.first, \"Non-Heap\" => dat.last }\n      end\n  \n      def start\n        @thread = Thread.new do\n          while true do\n            @samples << memory_usage.map {|m| m.to_f / (1024*1024) }\n            @samples.shift if @samples.size > @keep\n            @callback.call(self) if @callback\n            sleep @interval\n          end\n        end\n        @thread.join\n      end\n    end\n\nHere, we're encapsulating the `JFrame` and `ImagePanel` logic in an\n`ImageApp` class.\n\n    class ImageApp\n      attr_accessor :title\n  \n      def initialize(image = nil)\n        @title = \"Preview\"\n        @image = image\n      end\n  \n      def image=(image)\n        @image = image\n        @panel.image = image if @panel\n      end\n  \n      def show\n        @frame = JFrame.new(@title)\n        @frame.set_bounds 0, 0, @image.width + 20, @image.height + 40\n        @panel = @frame.add(ImagePanel.new(@image, 10, 10))\n        @frame.visible = true\n      end\n    end\n\nWe'll also need to add a method to `ImagePanel` to assign a new image\nto it and force a repaint.\n\n    class ImagePanel\n      def image=(image)\n        @image = image\n        repaint\n      end\n    end\n\nLet's also add a convenience method to Gruff to create a Java image\nobject.\n\n    class Gruff::Base\n      def to_image\n        ImageIO.read(ByteArrayInputStream.new(to_blob.to_java_bytes))\n      end\n    end\n\n\nNow, let's start up a MemorySampler with a callback that repeatedly\nupdates our `ImageApp` with a Gruff image generated from the most\nrecent samples.\n\n    @app = ImageApp.new\n    @app.title = \"Memory\"\n    MemorySampler.new do |s|\n      g = Gruff::Line.new(\"400x300\")\n      g.title = @app.title\n      g.y_axis_label = \"MB\"\n      s.samples.each_pair {|key,val| g.data(key, val) }\n      g.labels = {}\n      g.hide_dots = true\n      @app.image = g.to_image\n      @app.show unless @started\n      @started = true\n    end.start\n\nNow you should be seeing a window with a continuously updating graph\nof the VM's memory usage, all in right around 100 lines of code! Also,\nyou can easily change the server to which you connect, and monitor the\nmemory in another VM. For example, here's a profile of Glassfish\nstarting up and serving requests to a Rails application:\n\n![gf-mem](http://img.skitch.com/20081215-rskuwpd64huedjrfqj8jdnxfhf.jpg)\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nIn this article I've given you a taste of the kinds of mashups of Ruby\nand Java tech that JRuby so easily allows. JRuby makes installation\nand deployment of Gruff graphs easy, and allows you to access VM\nstatistics and monitoring data in an idiomatically Ruby way with the\nJMX gem.\n\nIf you're interested in playing with these examples further, do check\nout the [bundle I made available on Github][4]. The example code is\nincluded (in a slightly different form from the examples above) in the\n`lib/rubyadvent` directory. If you want to use the JRuby that I\ninclude in the bundle, just add `advent-jruby/bin` to your path. Each\nexample is accessible through a Rake task. Just run `jruby -S rake` to\nsee what's available:\n\n    To run an example, re-run 'jruby -S rake' with one of the following tasks:\n    rake gruff:simple  # Simple Gruff example with JRuby\n    rake irb           # Run IRB with Gruff, RMagick4J and JMX loaded\n    rake jmx:memory    # Simple JMX memory monitoring example: print memory usage\n    rake jmx:tracker   # Gruff/JMX example plotting memory usage over time\n\nHope you enjoyed this installment of the Ruby Advent Calendar. Happy\nholidays, and happy Ruby hacking!\n\n[1]: http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff\n[2]: http://code.google.com/p/rmagick4j/\n[3]: http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo?id=53\n[4]:

The design goal is \"to make instrumentation as simple as logging.\" Lowering the effort needed to add instrumentation will encourage developers to add monitoring code where ever it makes sense.\n\n[wiki](http://erma.wikidot.com/)\n[code](http://github.com/erma/erma)\n[mail](http://groups.google.com/group/erma-core)\n\n# Build Instructions #\n\nERMA is built with gradle (http://www.gradle.org/).  You can get started quickly by using the included gradle wrapper like this:\n\n> `./gradlew`\n\nGradle will automatically be downloaded from the location specified in gradle-wrapper.properties and installed.  You may also run targets from an existing Gradle installation if you choose (in this case substitute gradle for ./gradlew to execute the tasks).\n\nThe codebase is divided into multiple subprojects: erma-api, erma-lib and extensions (subprojects in erma-ext).  erma-api contains the basic constructs used to instrument code.  erma-lib contains the objects one would typically spring wire into an application to bootstrap and configure the MonitoringEngine.  erma-ext projects are those that extend ERMA to integrate with other third-party projects.\n\n## Build Targets ##\n\nlist available tasks :\n\n> `./gradlew -t`\n\ngenerate javadocs in build/docs/ :\n\n> `./gradlew javadoc`\n\nbuild all source, jars, run junit tests, and generate junit reports in each subproject build/reports/tests/ :\n\n> `./gradlew build`\n","language":[{"lang":"Java","bytes":540054}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"ChangeLog","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"build.gradle","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/build.gradle","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/Aggregator.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/Attribute.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/AttributeUndefinedException.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/CantCoerceException.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/CompositeMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/Decomposer.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/InheritableStrategy.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/Monitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/MonitorProcessor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/MonitorProcessorAttachable.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/MonitorProcessorFactory.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/MonitoringEngine.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/MonitoringLevel.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/annotation","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/annotation/Monitored.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/engine","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/engine/MapBasedInheritableStrategy.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/engine/StackBasedInheritableStrategy.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/AbstractCompositeMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/AbstractMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/AttributeHolder.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/AttributeMap.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/CompositeAttributeHolder.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/CompositeAttributeMap.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/EventMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/TransactionMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/ValueMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/serializable","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/serializable/SerializableCompositeMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/monitor/serializable/SerializableMonitor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/template","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/template/TransactionMonitorCallback.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/template/TransactionMonitorTemplate.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/CompositeMonitorTestBase.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/MockDecomposer.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/MockMonitorProcessor.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/MockMonitorProcessorFactory.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/MonitorTestBase.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/test/OC.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"erma-api/test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java/com/orbitz","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api","type":"Tree"},{"path":"erma-api/test/src/java/com/orbitz/monitoring/api/AttributeMapTest.java","typ

Shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers added on to the Test::Unit framework.  It's fully compatible with your existing tests, and requires no retooling to use.\n\nHelpers:: #context and #should give you rSpec like test blocks.\n          In addition, you get nested contexts and a much more readable syntax.\nMacros:: Generate hundreds of lines of Controller and ActiveRecord tests with these powerful macros.\n         They get you started quickly, and can help you ensure that your application is conforming to best practices.\nAssertions:: Many common rails testing idioms have been distilled into a set of useful assertions.\n\n= Usage\n\n=== Context Helpers (Shoulda::Context)\n\nStop killing your fingers with all of those underscores...  Name your tests with plain sentences!\n\n  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    context \"A User instance\" do\n      setup do\n        @user = User.find(:first)\n      end\n\n      should \"return its full name\" do\n        assert_equal 'John Doe', @user.full_name\n      end\n\n      context \"with a profile\" do\n        setup do\n          @user.profile = Profile.find(:first)\n        end\n\n        should \"return true when sent #has_profile?\" do\n          assert @user.has_profile?\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nProduces the following test methods:\n\n  \"test: A User instance should return its full name.\"\n  \"test: A User instance with a profile should return true when sent #has_profile?.\"\n\nSo readable!\n\n=== ActiveRecord Tests (Shoulda::ActiveRecord::Macros)\n\nQuick macro tests for your ActiveRecord associations and validations:\n\n  class PostTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    fixtures :all\n\n    should_belong_to :user\n    should_have_many :tags, :through => :taggings\n\n    should_require_unique_attributes :title\n    should_require_attributes :body, :message => /wtf/\n    should_require_attributes :title\n    should_only_allow_numeric_values_for :user_id\n  end\n\n  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase\n    should_have_many :posts\n\n    should_not_allow_values_for :email, \"blah\", \"b lah\"\n    should_allow_values_for :email, \"a@b.com\", \"asdf@asdf.com\"\n    should_ensure_length_in_range :email, 1..100\n    should_ensure_value_in_range :age, 1..100\n    should_protect_attributes :password\n  end\n\nMakes TDD so much easier.\n\n=== Controller Tests (Shoulda::Controller::Macros)\n\nMacros to test the most common controller patterns...\n\n  context \"on GET to :show for first record\" do\n    setup do\n      get :show, :id => 1\n    end\n\n    should_assign_to :user\n    should_respond_with :success\n    should_render_template :show\n    should_not_set_the_flash\n\n    should \"do something else really cool\" do\n      assert_equal 1, assigns(:user).id\n    end\n  end\n\n=== Helpful Assertions (Shoulda::Assertions)\n\nMore to come here, but have fun with what's there.\n\n  assert_same_elements([:a, :b, :c], [:c, :a, :b])\n  assert_contains(['a', '1'], /\\d/)\n  assert_contains(['a', '1'], 'a')\n\n=== 3rd Party and Application Specific Macros\n\nAny *.rb file under RAILS_ROOT/test/shoulda_macros/ or vendor/(plugins|gems)/gem_name/shoulda_macros/ will be automatically required when you run your tests.  This allows you to distribute macros with your plugins, or to organize the macros inside your application.  Remember to add your macro to Test::Unit::TestCase in the macro file:\n\n  # test/shoulda_macros/security.rb\n  class Test::Unit::TestCase\n    def self.should_be_denied(opts = {})\n      should_set_the_flash_to(opts[:flash] || /Please log in/i)\n      should_redirect_to(opts[:redirect]   || 'login_url')\n    end\n  end\n\n= Rails Installation\n\n=== As a Gem\n\nUse this if you prefer to use versioned releases of shoulda.

Artificial Intelligence Engine","readme":"------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* WELCOME!\n\nThis is the RebeccaAIML Project.  \n\nRebeccaAIML is an enterprise cross platform open source \nAIML development platform. RebeccaAIML supports C++, Java,\nC#, and Python as well as many other programming languages\nand AIML development out of the box.  RebeccaAIML also \ncomes with an array of AIML administration tools, great \ndocumentation, and an eclipse AIML editor plugin. \n\n{ From the redistributor: \n\n## NOTE: This distrobution is not the official RebeccaAIML\nproject, but a re-distrobution for GNU/Linux users, because \nthe authors source code was written in Visual Studio and didn't\nplay well with modern Linux machines. This source has been\nsuccessfully tested on Ubuntu and Gentoo machines, with only\nstandard Ubuntu .debs and standard Gentoo .ebuilds.\n\nHOWEVER, This is not the authors release, the last release from\nthe original author was in 2007.\n\n}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* AUTHOR and LICENSE\n\nFrank Hassanabad : foreverlinux@yahoo.com\nDrop me an email if you have any problems.\n\nSee 'copyright' about the GPLv3 licence in which \nthis project is covered.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* PROGRAMMING WITH THE API AND FRAMEWORK\n\nSo how do you start programming with the API and/or framework?  \nFor a quick start check out the source code of the samples.  \nyou'll find them under [src\\samples]. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE APIs AND FRAMEWORK\n\nWhere's the full documentation of the APIs and FRAMEWORK at?  You can \nfind the documentation of the api and framework in the [doc] directory.\nunder Linux that's  [/usr/share/librebecca/doc]\n\nYou can also find more documentation at the RebeccaAIML website: \nhttp://rebecca-aiml.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* COMPILING THE SOURCE CODE OF THE ENGINE\n\nI want to compile the complete source code of the engine and not \njust the samples.  How do I do that?\n\n[/usr/share/librebecca/doc/linuxInstall.txt] for Linux.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE DIRECTORIES AND FILES\n\nCan you give me an overview of all the files and directories of \nRebeccaAIML?  Under Windows these files are located at \n[<wherever_you_installed>\\...] and under Linux these files are \nlocated at [/usr/share/Rebecca]\n\nIf you have the source or binary distribution you\nhave the following directories of:\n\n[aiml]      Varoius AIML data sets that are included \n            with the RebeccaAIML distribution and used \n\t\t\tby the samples.\n\n[conf]      Various configuration files that the samples\n            use when they load.\n\n[doc]       Where all the documentation is located. \n            Everything from the API documentation, user guide,\n            to how to install Rebecca from full source \n            code is here.\n\n[include]   All the include files for building against \n            RebeccaAIML with C++.  \n            \t\t\t\n[resources] Various resource files needed by every sample \n            is located here.  \n\t\t\t\n[src]       Source code of samples and the RebeccaAIML \n            engine if you downloaded the source code.\n\nIf you have the source code distribution you have \na few extra added directories of:\n\n[src/rebecca]           Source code of the engine\t\t\t  \n\n[include/rebecca/impl]  Header files only needed for building\n                        the engine.\t\t\t  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t   \nENJOY and don't hesitate to email with questions, problems, or\nsuggestions on how to improve this project!\n\t\t\t   \n\nGIT'd By: Drake Justice: hallowname@gmail.com (no flame

It will ask you to create an event.\nChoose an event name and click \"Create New Event\".  It will put you on the add\ngift page.  Put in a gift name, sender name(s), and receiver name(s) and click\n\"Add Gift\".  It will add the gift to the database and put you back at the add\ngift page, but this time you'll have checkboxes for the senders and receivers\nyou entered.  If you want to use a sender or receiver that's not in one of\nthe select boxes, type the name in (you can separate names with a comma).  This\nis true even if you want to use a sender or receiver that doesn't have a\ncheckbox (you can always type in the names, it doesn't create duplicates).\n\n== Other pages\n\n=== Event\n\n* Associate Receivers: You can use this to associate other people as possible\n  receivers in the current event (so they show up in the receivers select box\n  on the add gift page).  Mostly useful if you have multiple events and most\n  of the people in this event were also in a previous event.\n* Associate Senders: Same as Associate Receivers, but for senders.\n* Change Event: Change the currently used event, either by picking another\n  event or adding a new event.\n\n=== Reports\n\n* In Chronological Order: Simple report listing all gifts received in\n  chronological order.\n* By Receiver: Gives separate reports for each receiver.  When printing the\n  reports, uses one page per receiver.\n* By Sender: Similar to By Receiver, but for senders.\n* Summary: Shows the total number of gifts, as well as totals by sender\n  and receiver.\n* Summary Crosstab: Shows for each sender/receiver pair, how many gifts the\n  sender gave the receiver.\n* Thank You Notes: Gives separate reports for each receiver, showing gifts\n  received from people who weren't receivers at the event.  When printing\n  the reports, uses one page per receiver.\n  \n=== Other\n\nThis are simple scaffold pages for changing data in the database.  You can\nuse them to rename an event, person, or gift, to modify senders/receivers\nof gifts after they have been added, or to delete gifts.\n \n== Running the specs\n\n=== Prerequisites to run the specs\n\n* rake\n* rspec 1.3+\n* capybara\n\n=== Setup\n\nCreate the db and run the migration:\n\n  createdb giftsmas_test\n  sequel -m /path/to/giftsmas/migrate postgres:///giftsmas_test\n\n== Running the specs\n\nThe specs are run with rake:\n\n  rake spec # Unit tests\n  rake integration # Integration tests\n  rake # Both\n  \n== License\n\nGiftsmas is released under the MIT License.

Improves page load times. Simplifies link and event tracking.","readme":"h1. jQuery Google Analytics Plugin\n\nNOTE This plugin hasn't been updated to work with the latest version of Google Analytics. I recommend you fork and improve the code and submit a patch.\n\nh2. Introduction\n\nThe jQuery Google Analytics plugin does the following:\n\n* improves page load times by deferring the loading of Google Analytics to after the page has been loaded. (Note Google is currently testing their own implementation which does the same)\n* simplifies event and link tracking.\n* helps you track error pages (404, 500) as described \"here\":http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=86927.\n\nh2. Installation\n\nh3. JavaScript\n\nInside the head tag, first include the jQuery JavaScript file, then the jQuery Google Analytics file:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"javascripts/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"javascripts/jquery.google-analytics.js\"></script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nh3. Usage\n\nWith the script loaded you now have access to these new methods:\n\n* $.trackPage('UA-XXX-XXX') - Adds Google Analytics tracking to the page it's called from. By default, the loading of Google analytics is done after the onload event.\n* $.('selector').track - Used in combination with jQuery selectors to add click tracking, or tracking of other jQuery events, to matching elements. For example: $('selector').track() \n* $.trackEvent - Used for custom event tracking. Same as _pageTracker.trackEvent, but checks that analytics isn't blocked. For example: $.trackEvent('category', 'action', 'label')\n\n\nh4. Page tracking\n\nTo enable Google Analytics page tracking add a call to $.trackPage inside the head tag:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <head>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    $.trackPage('UA-YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID')\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nTo improve page load times, the script defers the loading of the Google Analytics script to after the page has been loaded (window.onload). To disable this feature, set the onload parameter to false:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $.trackPage('UA-YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID', {onload: false})\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nh5. Tracking 404 and 500 errors\n\nThis plugin implements tracking of error pages \"as described on the Google Analytics Help pages\":http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=86927\n\nTo track an error, simply set the status_code parameter to the response code, as shown in this example:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $.trackPage('UA-YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID', {status_code: 404}); // Track a 404 error\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nh4. Link tracking\n\nLink tracking is done by selecting the elements you want to track with jQuery selectors. By default the click event is tracked, but this can be changed as I'll explain later.\n\nThe following is an example of how to track outgoing links (to also track internal links, set the skip_internal parameter to false):\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n    $('.normal a').track();\n\n    $('.sidebar a').track({\n      category : 'sidebar'\n    });\n\n    $('.footer a').track({\n      category : 'footer'\n    });\n\n    // Support any markup you want, eg. http://microformats.org/wiki/xFolk\n    $('.complex a').track({\n      // Use class as category. \" tracked\" is added by plugin...\n      category : function(element) { return element.attr('class').replace(' tracked', '') }\n    });\n  });\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nThe first example selects links in the sidebar and sets the category to 'sidebar'.\n\nThe second example selects links in the footer and sets the category to 'footer'.\n\nThe third example selects links located inside the \"complex div\" and uses the link's class as category.\n\nSee index.html for complete examples.\n\n\n\nh4. Custom event tracking\n\nYou can also track events by calling the trackEvent method:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n    $.trackEvent(category, action, label, value);\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\n\nh4. Parameters\n\nThe track methods accepts the following parameters:\n\n* \"category\":http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerGuide.html#Categories - required string used to group events. Default is autodetected: internal or external.\n* \"action\":http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerGuide.html#Actions - required string used to define event type, eg. click, download. Default is click.\n* \"label\":http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerGuide.html#Labels - optional label to attach to event, eg. buy. Default is href attribute's value.\n* \"value\":http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerGuide.html#Values - optional numerical value to attach to event, eg. price. Default null.\n\nAdditional parameters supported by the track(), not the trackEvent(), method: \n\n* skip_internal - Default true. If true then internal links are not tracked.\n* event_name - Default click. Name of the event to track.\n\nThe following snippet shows you how to define the parameters:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n    $('.sidebar a').track({\n      category : 'sidebar',\n      action   : 'click',\n      label    : 'buy',\n      value    : '10.49'\n    });\n  });\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nIf no parameters are given then sensible defaults are used, which should work in most cases.\n\nNote that you can also use functions instead of string values. Functions are useful for extracting the values from the HTML itself (metadata).\n\nh4. Tracking mouseover and other events\n\nThe default behavior is to track the click event. This can be changed to any other jQuery event by setting the *event_name* parameter to the name of the event you want to track, as shown in this example:\n\n<pre>\n  <code>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $(document).ready(function(){\n    $('.normal a').track({event_name: 'mouseover'});\n  </script>\n  </code>\n</pre>\n\nh4. Debugging\n\nYou can print debug statements to the Firebug console by setting the debug option. Default: false.\n\nTo enable: <code>$.fn.track.defaults.debug = true;</code>\n\nh2. Todo\n\n* Review code\n* Refactor code\n\nh2. Author\n\n\"Christian Hellsten\":http://christianhellsten.com (\"Aktagon Ltd.\":http://aktagon.com)\n\nh3.

engine","readme":"What is it?\n===========\n\nTypo is a weblog system written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails. Weblogs are cool,\nweblogs are \"in\" and everyone who writes code has an different opinion on how\na weblog should be written. Typo is our take on it. Typo is designed to be\nusable by programmers and non-programmers, while being easy for programmers to\nextend.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nCurrently you need all of those things to get typo to run:\n\n * Ruby 1.8.6 or Ruby Enterprise Edition. \n * Rails 2.2, Typo 5.2 DOES NOT support Rails 2.1.\n * A database.  Typo supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n * Ruby drivers for your database.\n * For best performance, you should have a web server running either\n   Apache, Lighttpd or Nginx, along with FastCGI, mongrel or thin. You can use \n   Ruby's built-in web server for low-volume testing.\n   We recommend the use of Apache + mod_rails (aka Passenger) for fast and \n   easy deployment along with speed.\n * rspec, rcov and ruby-debug are necessary to run the test suit.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nSee doc/Installer.text and doc/typo-5.2-release-notes.txt.\n\nUsage\n======\n\nTypo's administrative interface is available at\nhttp://your.domain.com/admin. You can use this to post articles and\nchange Typo's configuration settings. For posting new content, you can\neither use this administrative web interface or a desktop blog editor\nlike MarsEdit or Ecto. For a short list of clients which are confirmed\nto work please visit http://typosphere.org/wiki/DesktopClients.\n\nClient setup\n============\n\nSet your desktop client to Movable Type API and

This may\naffect users who use MetaWeblog API clients, though hopefully it will only\naffect them for the better.\n\nThe problem: The existing code is attempting to use UTC for all dateTime\nvalues, but failing, because it sometimes returns strings where dateTime\nvalues are expected.\n\nWhy the existing code is correct to _attempt_ to use UTC everywhere:\n\nThe XML-RPC spec does not allow serialized dateTime values to contain a\ntime zone, and instead relies on clients and servers to agree on a\nconvention for interpreting dateTime values:\n\n  http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec\n\n  * What timezone should be assumed for the dateTime.iso8601 type? UTC?\n    localtime?\n\n    Don't assume a timezone. It should be specified by the server in its\n    documentation what assumptions it makes about timezones.\n\nAs you can see from the following discussion, the MetaWeblog API inherits\nthis ambiguity:\n\n  http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=c210531e-646c-41e8-a81e-f3efd4ba8df4\n\nAs noted in that comment thread, most blogging tools have standardized on\nusing UTC everywhere, since it can be unambiguously interpreted without a\ntimezone.\n\nThe fixes:\n\n  1) First, in the test cases, Time.now.midnight.utc and\n     Time.now.utc.midnight are _not_ the same in most time zones.  This is\n     fixed by relying on the previously computed value of\n     'article.published_at' instead of checking the clock a second time.\n     Doing this also allows us to work around a hypothetical test case\n     failure which would occur if the clock passed midnight in the middle\n     of the test case.\n\n  2) Second, ActionWebService will simply Do The Right Thing with dates,\n     but only if it can identify them as such.  Previously, the function\n     MetaWeblogService.article_dto_from would actually try to serialize\n     dates as strings instead of XML-RPC dateTime values.  This caused a\n     variety of time zone lossage, and made the test case failures very\n     hard to debug.  The biggest consequence of this bug: getPost would\n     return a string instead of an XML-RPC dateTime value for dateCreated.\n\nI've added a test case to make sure that we can round-trip dates without\ncorrupting them."},"author_login":"emk","committer_login":"emk"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Eric Kidd","email":"git@randomhacks.net"},"commiter":{"name":"Eric Kidd","email":"git@randomhacks.net"},"message":"Fix spec failures in accounts_controller_spec.rb\n\nIt looks like some of these unit tests haven't been run in a while.

Test.\n\n= Homepage\n\nThe Ruby/Git homepage is currently at : \n\nhttp://jointheconversation.org/rubygit\n\nGit public hosting of the project source code is at:\n\nhttp://github/schacon/ruby-git\n\n= Install\n\nYou can install Ruby/Git like this:\n\n$ sudo gem install schacon-git --source=http://gems.github.com\n\n= Major Objects\n\nGit::Base - this is the object returned from a Git.open or Git.clone.  \nMost major actions are called from this object.\n\nGit::Object - this is the base object for your tree, blob and commit objects,\nreturned from @git.gtree or @git.object calls.  the Git::AbstractObject will\nhave most of the calls in common for all those objects.\n\nGit::Diff - returns from a @git.diff command.  It is an Enumerable that returns\nGit::Diff:DiffFile objects from which you can get per file patches and insertion/deletion\nstatistics.  You can also get total statistics from the Git::Diff object directly.\n\nGit::Status - returns from a @git.status command.  It is an Enumerable that returns\nGit:Status::StatusFile objects for each object in git, which includes files in the working\ndirectory, in the index and in the repository.  Similar to running 'git status' on the command\nline to determine untracked and changed files.\n\nGit::Branches - Enumerable object that holds Git::Branch objects.  You can call .local or .remote\non it to filter to just your local or remote branches.\n\nGit::Remote - A reference to a remote repository that is tracked by this repository.\n\nGit::Log - An Enumerable object that references all the Git::Object::Commit objects that encompass\nyour log query, which can be constructed through methods on the Git::Log object, like:\n\n @git.log(20).object(\"some_file\").since(\"2 weeks ago\").between('v2.6', 'v2.7').each { |commit| [block] } \n\n= Examples\n\nHere are a bunch of examples of how to use the Ruby/Git package. \n\nFirst you have to remember to require rubygems if it's not.

simplified way to build and package Ruby C extensions using Rake as glue.","readme":"= rake-compiler\r\n\r\nrake-compiler aims to help Gem developers while dealing with Ruby C\r\nextensions, simplifiying the code and reducing the duplication.\r\n\r\nIt follows *convention over configuration* and set an standarized \r\nstructure to build and package C extensions in your gems.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of expriences dealing with several Gems that required \r\nnative extensions across platforms and different user configurations \r\nwhere details like portability and clarity of code were lacking.\r\n\r\n== An Overview\r\n\r\nLet's summarize what rake-compiler provides:\r\n\r\n* No custom rake tasks required. Less code duplication and errors.\r\n\r\n* Painlessly build extensions on different platforms (Linux, OSX and Windows).\r\n\r\n* Allow multiple extensions be compiled inside the same gem.\r\n\r\n* Mimics RubyGems installation process, so helps as test environment.\r\n\r\n* Simplify cross platform compilation of extensions (target Windows from Linux).\r\n\r\n== I'm sold! show me how to use it! (Installation)\r\n\r\nUsage of rake-compiler is pretty much straight forward.\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to install the gem:\r\n\r\n  $ gem install rake-compiler\r\n\r\nSince this package is in constant evolution, you could try installing it\r\nfrom GitHub:\r\n\r\n  $ gem install luislavena-rake-compiler --source http://gems.github.com\r\n\r\nThe development gem is usually in pretty good shape actually.\r\n\r\n== Now what? (Usage)\r\n\r\nNow that you have the gem installed, let's give your project some structure.\r\n\r\n=== Structure\r\n\r\nLet's say we want to compile an extension called 'hello_world', so we should\r\norganize the code and folders that will help rake-compiler do it's job:\r\n\r\n    |-- ext\r\n    |   `-- hello_world\r\n    |       |-- extconf.rb\r\n    |       `-- hello_world.c\r\n    |-- lib\r\n    `-- Rakefile\r\n\r\nTIP: Having a consistent folder structure will help developers and newcomers\r\nto find code and also contribute back to your project more easily.\r\n\r\n=== Adding the code\r\n\r\nSo now it's time to introduce the code to compile our extension:\r\n\r\n    # File: Rakefile\r\n    \r\n    require 'rake/extensiontask'\r\n    \r\n    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('hello_world')\r\n\r\nOk, that's it. No other line of code.\r\n\r\n=== Compile process\r\n\r\nThose *two* lines of code automatically added the needed rake tasks to build\r\nthe hello_world extension:\r\n\r\n  $ rake -T\r\n  (in /home/user/my_extesion)\r\n  rake compile                # Compile the extension(s)\r\n  rake compile:hello_world    # Compile just the hello_world extension\r\n\r\nSimply calling <tt>compile</tt>:\r\n\r\n  $ rake compile\r\n\r\nWill do all the compile process for us, putting the result extension inside\r\n<tt>lib</tt> directory.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Please be aware that building C extensions requires the proper\r\ndevelopment environment for your Platform, which includes libraries, headers\r\nand build tools. Check your distro / vendor documentation on how to install it.\r\n\r\n=== Generate native gems\r\n\r\nA common usage scenario of rake-compiler is generate native gems that bundles\r\nyour extensions.\r\n\r\nThis got over-simplified with <tt>Rake::ExtensionTask</tt>:\r\n\r\n    # somewhere in your Rakefile, define your gem spec\r\n    spec = Gem::Specification.new do |s|\r\n      s.name = \"my_gem\"\r\n      s.platform = Gem::Platform::RUBY\r\n      s.extensions = FileList[\"ext/**/extconf.rb\"]\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # add your default gem packing task\r\n    Rake::GemPackageTask.new(spec) do |pkg|\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # feed your ExtensionTask with your spec\r\n    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('hello_world', spec)\r\n\r\nNow, as usual, you can build your pure-ruby gem (standard output):\r\n\r\n  $ rake gem\r\n  (in /projects/oss/my_gem.git)\r\n  mkdir -p pkg\r\n    Successfully built RubyGem\r\n    Name: my_gem\r\n    Version: 0.1.0\r\n    File: my_gem-0.1.0.gem\r\n  mv my_gem-0.1.0.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0.gem\r\n\r\nPlus, you have the functionality to build native versions of the gem:\r\n\r\n  # rake native gem\r\n  (... compilation output ...)\r\n  mkdir -p pkg\r\n    Successfully built RubyGem\r\n    Name: my_gem\r\n    Version: 0.1.0\r\n    File: my_gem-0.1.0.gem\r\n  mv my_gem-0.1.0.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0.gem\r\n    Successfully built RubyGem\r\n    Name: my_gem\r\n    Version: 0.1.0\r\n    File: my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem\r\n  mv my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem pkg/my_gem-0.1.0-x86-mingw32.gem\r\n\r\nYou get two gems for the price of one.\r\n\r\n=== What about breaking the standards? (Customization)\r\n\r\nIn case you want to bend the convention established, rake-compiler let you\r\npersonalize several settings for <tt>Rake::ExtensionTask</tt>:\r\n\r\n    Rake::ExtensionTask.new do |ext|\r\n      ext.name = 'hello_world'                # indicate the name of the extension.\r\n      ext.ext_dir = 'ext/weird_world'         # search for 'hello_world' inside it.\r\n      ext.lib_dir = 'lib/my_lib'              # put binaries into this folder.\r\n      ext.config_script = 'custom_extconf.rb' # use instead of 'extconf.rb' default\r\n      ext.tmp_dir = 'tmp'                     # temporary folder used during compilation.\r\n      ext.source_pattern = \"*.{c,cpp}\"        # monitor file changes to allow simple rebuild.\r\n      ext.config_options << '--with-foo'      # supply additional configure options to config script.\r\n      ext.gem_spec = spec                     # optional indicate which gem specification\r\n                                              # will be used to based on.\r\n    end\r\n\r\n== Future is now: Cross compilation\r\n\r\nrake-compiler provides now an standarized way to generate, from Linux or OSX\r\nboth extensions and gem binaries for Windows!\r\n\r\nIt takes advantages from GCC host/target to build binaries (for target) on \r\ndifferent OS (hosts).\r\n\r\n=== How I enjoy this?\r\n\r\nBesides having the development tool chain installed (GCC), you should install\r\nalso <tt>mingw32</tt> cross compilation package.\r\n\r\nDependending on your operating system distribution, a simple <tt>apt-get install mingw32</tt>\r\nwill be enough.\r\n\r\nPlease check OSX documentation about installing mingw32 from macports.\r\n\r\n=== I have my toolchain, now what?\r\n\r\nYou need to build Ruby for Windows.\r\n\r\nRelax, no need to freak out. rake-compiler do it for you:\r\n\r\n  rake-compiler cross-ruby\r\n\r\nAnd you're done. It will automatically download, configure and compile latest\r\nstable version of Ruby for Windows, and place it into <tt>~/.rake-compiler</tt>\r\n\r\nIf, instead, you want to build another version than the default one, please\r\nsupply a <tt>VERSION</tt>:\r\n\r\n  rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.8.6-p114\r\n\r\n=== Let's build some gems!\r\n\r\nNow, you only need to use additional options in your extension defintion:\r\n\r\n    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', gem_spec) do |ext|\r\n      ext.cross_compile = true                # enable cross compilation (requires cross compile toolchain)\r\n      ext.cross_platform = 'i386-mswin32'     # forces the Windows platform instead of the default one\r\n                                              # configure options only for cross compile\r\n      ext.cross_config_options << '--with-something'\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBy default, cross compilation targets 'i386-mingw32' which is default GCC platform\r\nfor Ruby.\r\n\r\nTo target gems for current Ruby official distribution, please force the platform\r\nto the one shown before.\r\n\r\n=== Magician doing some tricks, don't blink!\r\n\r\nCompiles keeps being simple:\r\n\r\n  rake cross compile\r\n\r\nAnd now, build your gems for Windows is just 5 more letters:\r\n\r\n  rake cross native gem\r\n\r\nAnd you're done, yeah.\r\n\r\n=== Take it even further\r\n\r\nYou can specify against with version of Ruby you want to build the extension:\r\n\r\n  rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8\r\n\r\nIf you installed <tt>1.9.1</tt>, you can do:\r\n\r\n  rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9\r\n\r\n== Future\r\n\r\nrake-compiler is a work in progress and we will appreciate feedback during the\r\ndevelopment of it! (and contributions too!)\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about rake-compiler:\r\n\r\nBlog:      http://blog.mmediasys.com\r\nRubyForge: http://rubyforge.org/projects/rake-compiler\r\nGitHub:    http://github.com/luislavena/rake-compiler\r\n\r\n=== Some of the desired features\r\n\r\n* <tt>Rake::JavaJarTask</tt> to generate <tt>jar</tt> packages and gems for JRuby.\r\n\r\n  $ rake java gem\r\n\r\n== Disclaimer\r\n\r\nIf you have any trouble, don't hesitate to contact the author.

element.\n\nBased on {Four Sided PNG Drop Shadows}[http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/dropshadows2.html]\n\n== Usage\nIn a view do:\n <% four_sided_frame do %>\n \tYour content here\n <% end %>\n\nFor now images default to top-right.png, bottom-left.png and full-frame.png directly under public/images.\nThis can be overridden via options, e.g.\n <% four_sided_frame :top_right=>'path/to/image', :bottom_left=>'path/to/image', :full_frame=>'path/to/image' do %>\n \tYour content here\n <% end %>\n\nYou can also override just the base path of the images, keeping the names the same:\n <% four_sided_frame :base_path=>File.join(*%w(images my_frame)) do %>\n \tYour content here\n <% end %>\nThis will load the images from\n public/images/my_frame/[top-right.png|bottom-left.png|full-frame.png].\n\nCurrently png, gif and jpg are handled.\n\nYou can also specify an id to get a handle on the outermost element:\n <% four_sided_frame :id=>'your_id_here' do %>\n \tYour content here\n <% end %>\n\nBy default the frame shrink-wraps its content by positioning absolutely,\nto override this specify a shrink-wrapping option:\n* :left or :right to float left or right\n* A number to fix the frame's width to that amount of pixels\nExample:\n <% four_sided_frame :shrink_wrap=>:left do %>\n  \tYour content here\n <% end %>\nor\n <% four_sided_frame :shrink_wrap=>400 do %>\n  \tYour content here\n <% end %>\n\n== Further information\n* The corner images used must be squares of equal size.\n* The element directly wrapping the content has a class of 'content'.","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":5996}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"CHANGELOG","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Manifest","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.rdoc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"four_sided_frame.gemspec","type":"Blob"},{"path":"init.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/four_sided_frame.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/image_size.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/image_sizes","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/image_sizes/gif.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/image_sizes/jpg.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/image_sizes/png.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Arni

It is possible to change a #define and \r\nbuild with only C code, but the software rendering versions lose almost half \r\nits speed.  The OpenGL versions will not be effected very much.  The \r\ngas2masm tool was created to allow us to use the same source for the dos, \r\nlinux, and windows versions, but I don't really recommend anyone mess \r\nwith the asm code.\r\n\r\nThe original dos version of Quake should also be buildable from these \r\nsources, but we didn't bother trying.\r\n\r\nThe code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  \r\nYou should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do \r\nanything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch \r\nis that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the \r\nentire source code available for free to everyone.\r\n\r\nOur previous code releases have been under licenses that preclude \r\ncommercial exploitation, but have no clause forcing sharing of source code.  \r\nThere have been some unfortunate losses to the community as a result of \r\nmod teams keeping their sources closed (and sometimes losing them).  If \r\nyou are going to publicly release modified versions of this code, you must \r\nalso make source code available.  I would encourage teams to even go a step \r\nfarther and investigate using public CVS servers for development where \r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational \r\npurposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the \r\nfull license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear \r\nto have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate \r\nlicense agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the \r\nGPL.\r\n\r\nAll of the Quake data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the \r\noriginal terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if \r\nyou do a true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on \r\nthis code.\r\n\r\nI will see about having the license changed on the shareware episode of \r\nquake to allow it to be duplicated more freely (for linux distributions, for \r\nexample), but I can't give a timeframe for it.  You can still download one of \r\nthe original quake demos and use that data with the code, but there are \r\nrestrictions on the redistribution of the demo data.\r\n\r\nIf you never actually bought a complete version of Quake, you might want \r\nto rummage around in a local software bargain bin for one of the originals, \r\nor perhaps find a copy of the \"Quake: the offering\" boxed set with both \r\nmission packs.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dave \"Zoid\" Kirsh and Robert Duffy for doing the grunt work of \r\nbuilding this release.\r\n\r\nJohn Carmack\r\nId

It is a gem based on Ikai Lan's jruby-memcache-client project hosted at http://github.com/ikai/jruby-memcache-client/tree\n\nThis project is a JRuby wrapper of the Java MemCache library by Greg Whalin\n\nhttp://www.whalin.com/memcached/\n\nIn production, the standard Ruby MemCache client can cause a thread to hang. In the Glassfish application server, by default there are 5 Grizzly connectors that handle incoming requests. A site that uses MemCache heavily can quickly cause all Grizzly connectors to block and take down a site. I'm hoping that this work I am doing here will help others adopt JRuby as a production platform for their Ruby on Rails applications.\n\nThe Ruby MemCache library was never written with threaded applications in mind. All threads use the same socket, and multithreaded mode basically wraps the IO with a Mutex. The Java library provides several features that are not available in the Ruby MemCache library:\n\n- connection pooling\n- socket timeouts. In forks of the Ruby MemCache library this is achieved either with a Mongrel timeout or use of the Ruby Timeout class, which, at least at the writing of this README, will work unpredictably when being used as a failsafe against hanging IO.\n\nAs of right now this code only provides a very minimal amount of functionality, but it is enough to use with the Rails cache and cache_fu.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nThis is a ruby gem that can be installed from gemcutter.org.\n\nYou will first need to install the gemcutter gem and configure your system to use it:\n\njruby -S gem install gemcutter\njruby -S gem tumble\n\nYou will then be able to install the JRuby Memcache Client gem:\n\njruby -S gem install jruby-memcache-client\n\nJava Requirements\n-----------------\n\nThe underlying library used for this project was compiled using Java 6. You will not be able to run this gem under Java 5 out of the box. You can however clone http://github.com/gwhalin/Memcached-Java-Client and attempt to build it under Java 5 if you must. (You really should consider upgrading to Java 6 since Oracle no longer supports Java 5.)\n\nReplacing Rail's MemCache Client\n--------------------------------\n\nRails ships with a bundled copy of the MemCache client. This client will prevent you from using this gem instead. Adding the following code into your environment.rb file:\n\nif RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /java/i\n  # Based on instructions from http://www.mikeperham.com/2009/03/03/using-memcache-client-16x-in-rails-23/\n  # Brain surgery to use our own version of memcache-client without\n  # having to modify activesupport directly.\n  # Unload any previous instance of the class\n  if Object.const_defined? :MemCache\n    Object.instance_eval { remove_const :MemCache }\n  end\n  # Pull in the exact version we want\n  gem 'jruby-memcache-client', '1.6.1'\n\n  # Ensure that the memcache-client path is at the front of the loadpath\n  $LOAD_PATH.each do |path|\n    if path =~ /jruby-memcache-client/\n      $LOAD_PATH.delete(path)\n      $LOAD_PATH.unshift(path)\n    end\n  end\n  # If Ruby thinks it's already loaded memcache.rb, force\n  # a reload otherwise just require.\n  if $\".find { |file| file =~ /\\Amemcache.rb\\Z/ }\n    load 'memcache.rb'\n  else\n    require 'memcache'\n  end\nend\n\nThis will remove the original MemCache client and load our version of the MemCache class instead.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\nThe JRuby MemCache client uses the same configuration options as the regular MemCache client. Here is how to build the configuration in your environment.rb file:\n\nmemcache_options = {\n  :namespace => 'fortaleza:production_live:',\n}\nmemcached_servers = [ ENV['MEMCACHED_LOCATION'] || '0.0.0.0:11211']\n\n# Constant used by libs\nCACHE = MemCache.new memcached_servers, memcache_options if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /java/\n\nNote that this may vary based on your particular configuration method and environment.\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":20341}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Gemfile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Gemfile.lock","type":"Blob"},{"path":"MIT-LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"VERSION.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"jruby-memcache-client.gemspec","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/java","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/java/java_memcached-release_2.5.1.jar","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/memcache.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/jruby_memcache_spec.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Frederic Jean","email":"fred@fredjean.net"},"commiter":{"name":"Frederic Jean","email":"fred@fredjean.net"},"message":"Merge pull request #7 from fredjean/master\n\nBrining changes into the main repo..."},"author_login":"fredjean","committer_login":"fredjean"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Sudhindra Rao [betarelease]","email":"sudhindra.r.rao@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Sudhindra Rao [betarelease]","email":"sudhindra.r.rao@gmail.com"},"message":"adding development gems to gemfile marks them as dependencies - this breaks applications that have conflicts with these gems.
