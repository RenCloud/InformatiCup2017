[{"id":45542,"name":"waves","full_name":"ab5tract/waves","owner_id":2742,"description":"Resource-oriented open source Ruby framework for Web apps.","readme":"= Waves\n\nAn open source framework for building web-applications with Ruby.\n\nWaves is ... Full-featured and thread-safe. Compact and extensible. Configuration *and* convention. RESTful but also Magical (very important).\n\nWaves is powered by ... Rack and Mongrel (HTTP server), Sequel or Filebase (storage), AutoCode (code reloading), LiveConsole (hot patching).\n\n== Links\n\n* {Web Site}[http://rubywaves.com/]\n  * {Tutorial}[http://rubywaves.com/tutorial]\n  * {Contributors}[http://rubywaves.com/credits]\n* {Source}[http://github.com/dyoder/waves]\n* {Issue tracker}[http://waves.lighthouseapp.com]\n* {Mailing List}[http://groups.google.com/group/rubywaves/]\n* {RubyForge}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/waves/]\n* {RDoc}[http://waves.rubyforge.org/]\n\n== Bootstrap!\n\n=== Get Waves\n\n  # latest release from Rubyforge\n  gem install waves\n  \n  # relatively recent gem build from master on GitHub\n  gem install dyoder-waves --source=http://gems.github.com\n  \n  # get the framework source\n  git clone git://github.com/dyoder/waves.git\n  cd waves\n  rake setup # install gem dependencies needed to work from source\n\n  \n=== Generate an application\n\n  # working from gems\n  waves ~/dev/web/killer_app\n  \n  # working from source\n  ./bin/waves ~/dev/web/killer_app\n\nThis generates a default application in the target directory.  The application module's name is the constant-cased version of the target directory basename, in this case KillerApp.  \n\n=== Configure basic settings\n\nConfigure your database connection using the +database+ attribute in <tt>configurations/development.rb</tt>.  The default ORM is currently Sequel, but there are other ORM layers in the works.  The value of +database+ is used with {Sequel.connect}[http://sequel.rubyforge.org/classes/Sequel.html#M000069].  Sequel's current documentation seems to favor a URL-style argument, but we have been getting along fine with a hash.\n\n  # With the Sequel sqlite adapter, the :database parameter is read as a path\n  # relative to the application root.\n  database :adapter => 'sqlite', :database => 'killer_app.db'\n\n\nCreate the initial db schema.  You can create a {Sequel migration}[http://sequel.rubyforge.org/classes/Sequel/Migration.html] with:\n\n  rake schema:migration name=users\n  vi schema/migrations/001_users.rb\n\nAnd you can run migrations with:\n\n  rake schema:migrate\n  \n  # or with a version number\n  rake schema:migrate version=1\n\n=== Mappings\n\nMappings are the Waves equivalent to routes.  An individual mapping consists of a request-matching construct and an arbitrary block.  When a request matches a mapping, Waves runs that block.  In the simplest case, you do all the response work in the block, a la {Sinatra}[http://sinatrarb.com/Home].  The standard Waves application also offers an MVC infrastructure, with a silent R for Resource.\n\nAn application's mappings live in <tt>configurations/mapping.rb</tt>.  The generated default mixes in some RESTy mappings as a helpful starter:\n\n* Waves::Mapping::PrettyUrls::RestRules\n* Waves::Mapping::PrettyUrls::GetRules\n\nHere's an example of a mapping adapted from GetRules:\n\n  # define some regexes\n  model_regex = '([\\w\\-]+)'\n  name_regex = '([\\w\\-\\_\\.\\+\\@]+)'; \n  \n  # display the given resource for the given model\n  path %r{^/#{model_regex}/#{name_regex}/?$}, :method => :get do | model, name |\n    resource( model ) do\n      controller { find( name ) }  |  view { |data| show( model => data ) }\n    end\n  end\n\nFor convenience, we defined regexes to match the model and name components of a path.  The +path+ method registers a block for use with requests where the path matches the supplied regex and where the HTTP method is GET.  The parameters passed to the block are the MatchData captures, i.e. the strings caught by +model_regex+ and +name_regex+. Note that you can supply strings instead of regexes to match exact text.  There is also a +url+ method for matching against the entire URL.\n\nSo a GET to \"/user/vyvyan\", for example, will pass \"user\" and \"vyvyan\" to the block as the model and name parameters, respectively.\n\nThe +resource+ method uses its argument to determine which controller and view will be instantiated for work done in its block.  Thus using the example above, we instantiate KillerApp::Controllers::User when we call +controller+ and KillerApp::Views::User when we call +view+.\n\nThe \"|\" character, as seen between the controller and view invocations, is a method that causes the result of the controller block to be passed into the view block.  Thus, in the controller block, an instance of Controllers::User calls its +find+ method with \"vyvyan\" as the argument.  The resulting object is passed to an instance of Views::User, which calls <tt>show( \"user\" => <some user object>)</tt>.  \n\nWhen undefined methods are called on a View, it attempts to render a template named after the method, with the method argument passed into the renderer as instance variables.  In the present example, the view will try to render <tt>templates/user/show.mab</tt> (or show.erb), providing it with @user = <the user object>.  You can, of course, define methods in the View to override this.\n\nYou can also register +before+, +after+, +wrap+, and +always+ mappings, with the same flexibility in matching requests.  The +handle+ method registers exception handling blocks, matching the exception class as well as the usual request attributes.\n\nFor more complete documentation, see Waves::Mapping.\n\n== Running an application\n\n  cd killer_app\n  \n  # defaults to running on 127.0.0.1:3000, using the development config, not daemonized.\n  waves-server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3001 -c production --daemon\n  \nThere are also rake tasks for running a cluster:\n\n  rake cluster:start mode=production # will read the Production config to determine which ports.\n\nYou can work in an irb-based console:\n\n  waves-console # or bin/waves-console\n\n\n== Where the Wavy Things Are\n\nA Waves application consists of a Ruby module structured with internal namespaces.  Thus:\n\n   KillerApp::Configurations\n   KillerApp::Controllers\n   KillerApp::Helpers\n   KillerApp::Models\n   KillerApp::Views\n\nAs you might have guessed, the working classes live in these namespaces.  E.g. <tt>KillerApp::Models::User</tt>.  \n\nThe otherwise harsh birth and life of these working classes is softened by {AutoCode}[http://autocode.rubyforge.org/], a sort of mini-Industrial Revolution for Ruby constants.  The Waves framework uses AutoCode to automatically generate controllers, models, views, etc. the first time each constant is needed by the application.  Waves looks for a file in a path that corresponds to the namespaced constant name.  If such exists, it gets loaded.  If not, Waves creates the class or module from sensible defaults.  \n\nFor example, when a Waves application encounters <tt>KillerApp::Views::MonkeyShines</tt> for the first time, it tries to load it from <tt>./views/monkey_shines.rb</tt>.  If that file does not exist, the app creates <tt>KillerApp::Views::MonkeyShines</tt> as a dupe of <tt>Waves::Views::Base</tt>.  \n\nThe result is that you only need to define models, views, etc. <i>when the default behavior stops meeting your needs.</i>\n\n\n=== Directory structure\n\n  ./\n    bin/\n      waves-console\n      waves-server\n    configurations/    # auto_load defined for Mapping; (auto_load || auto_create) anything else\n    controllers/       # (auto_load || auto_create)\n    helpers/           # (auto_load || auto_create)\n    lib/               \n      application.rb   # Application requires and includes, plus your configuration needs.\n      tasks/           # .rb and .rake files in here are automatically required by the main Rakefile\n    models/            # (auto_load || auto_create)\n    schema/            \n      migrations/      \n    startup.rb         # Framework setup.  Don't touch.\n    templates/         # Views expect templates to live here.\n    views/             # (auto_load || auto_create)\n\n=== Web Server\n\nYou can run on any {Rack-supported Web server}[], including Thin and Mongrel. Just edit your configuration file, like you did for your database settings(<tt>configurations/development.rb) and change the <tt>handler</tt> parameter. The default is Mongrel. For example, to switch to Thin:\n\n  handler ::Rack::Handler::Thin, :Host => host, :Port => port\n\nIn addition, you can also configure your Rack application the same way. Just edit the <tt>application</tt> parameter:\n\n  application do\n    use ::Rack::ShowExceptions\n    use Rack::CommonLogger\n    run ::Waves::Dispatchers::Default.new\n  end\n\n\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":184320},{"lang":"JavaScript","bytes":56147}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.rdoc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/configurations","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/configurations/default.rb.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/configurations/development.rb.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/configurations/production.rb.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/controllers/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/helpers/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/lib/application.rb.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/lib/tasks","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/lib/tasks/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/models/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/public","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/public/css","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/public/css/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/public/flash","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/public/flash/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/public/images","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/public/images/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/public/javascript","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/public/javascript/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/resources","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/resources/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/schema","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/schema/migrations","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/schema/migrations/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/startup.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/templates","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/templates/errors","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/templates/errors/not_found_404.mab","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/templates/errors/server_error_500.mab","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/templates/layouts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/templates/layouts/default.mab","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/tmp","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/tmp/sessions","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/tmp/sessions/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/classic/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/classic/views/.gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bin","type":"Tree"},{"path":"bin/waves","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/HISTORY","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/VERSION","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/tutorials","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/tutorials/blog1.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/tutorials/blog2.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/tutorials/blog3.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/tutorials/blog4.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/caches","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/caches/file.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/caches/memcached.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/caches/simple.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/caches/synchronized.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/commands","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/commands/console.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/commands/generate.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/commands/help.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/commands/start.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/controllers/mixin.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/dispatchers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/dispatchers/base.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/dispatchers/default.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/ext/float.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/hash.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/inflect.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/integer.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/kernel.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/module.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/object.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/proc.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/string.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/symbol.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/ext/tempfile.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/foundations","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/foundations/classic.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/foundations/compact.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/helpers/basic.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/doc_type.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/extended.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/form.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/formatting.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/layouts.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/model.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/helpers/view.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/layers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/layers/caches","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/layers/caches/file.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/layers/caches/file","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/layers/caches/file/engine.rb","type":

The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures.

To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:\n\n1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)\n2. [JavaScript Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)\n3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)\n\nWhat you need to build Sizzle\n---------------------------\n\nIn order to build Sizzle, you should have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later (earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested).\n\nFor Windows you have to download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/).\n\nMac OS users should install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,\nand `brew install node` to install Node.js.\n\nLinux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source\nif you swing that way. Easy-peasy.\n\n\nHow to build Sizzle\n----------------------------\n\nClone a copy of the main Sizzle git repo by running:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/jquery/sizzle.git\n```\n\nIn the `sizzle/dist` folder you will find build version of sizzle along with the minified copy and associated map file.\n\nTesting\n----------------------------\n\n- Run `npm install`, it's also preferable (but not necessarily) to globally install `grunt-cli` package â€“ `npm install -g grunt-cli`\n- Open `test/index.html` in the browser. Or run `npm test`/`grunt test` on the command line, if environment variables `BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY` are set up, it will attempt to use [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) service (you will need to install java on your machine so browserstack could connect to your local server), otherwise [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) will be used.\n- The actual unit tests are in the `test/unit` directory.\n\nDeveloping with [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)\n----------------------------\n\n- `npm run build` or `grunt` will lint, build, test, and compare the sizes of the built files.\n- `npm start` or `grunt start` can be run to re-lint, re-build, and re-test files as you change them.\n- `grunt -help` will show other available commands.\n","language":[{"lang":"JavaScript","bytes":256799},{"lang":"HTML","bytes":149117},{"lang":"CSS","bytes":18667}],"repository":[{"path":".bowerrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":".editorconfig","type":"Blob"},{"path":".gitattributes","type":"Blob"},{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":".jscsrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":".jshintrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":".mailmap","type":"Blob"},{"path":".npmrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":".travis.yml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"AUTHORS.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"CONTRIBUTING.md","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Gruntfile.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.md","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bower.json","type":"Blob"},{"path":"dist","type":"Tree"},{"path":"dist/sizzle.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"dist/sizzle.min.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"dist/sizzle.min.map","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/benchmark","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/benchmark/LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/benchmark/benchmark.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/dojo","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/dojo/LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/dojo/dojo.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.7.2","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.7.2/MIT-LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.7.2/jquery.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.8.3","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.8.3/MIT-LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery-1.8.3/jquery.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/jquery/MIT-LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/jquery/jquery.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/mootools-slick","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/mootools-slick/slick.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/nwmatcher","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/nwmatcher/MIT-LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/nwmatcher/nwmatcher.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/qunit","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/qunit/LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/qunit/qunit.css","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/qunit/qunit.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/qwery","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/qwery/LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/qwery/qwery.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/requirejs","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/requirejs/require.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/sizzle-old","type":"Tree"},{"path":"external/sizzle-old/LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"external/sizzle-old/sizzle.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"package.json","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed","type":"Tree"},{"path":"speed/.jshintrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/data","type":"Tree"},{"path":"speed/data/selector.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/images","type":"Tree"},{"path":"speed/images/favicon.ico","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/images/logo.png","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/index.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/selectors.css","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/selectors.large.css","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/selectors.small.css","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/speed.css","type":"Blob"},{"path":"speed/speed.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/.jshintrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/sizzle.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks","type":"Tree"},{"path":"tasks/commit.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/compile.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/dist.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/ensure_ascii.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/release.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/tag.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/test.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tasks/version.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/.jshintrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/data/empty.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/fixtures.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/mixed_sort.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/noConflict.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/testingPseudos.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/testinit.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/data/testrunner.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/index.html","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/karma","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/karma/.jshintrc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/karma/karma.conf.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/karma/launchers.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/unit","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/extending.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/unit/selector.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/unit/utilities.js","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Richard

And I am not convinced that the performance problem is related to tokenization or compilation, or even within Sizzle at all—it's just jQuery calling into Sizzle too often in a tight loop: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c11becbb692f7707443eb2582543dfe96e8319e6/src/event.js#L421-L426\n","path":"","user":{"name":"gibson042","email":""}},{"body":"Yea, I was ignoring progressive calls.\n","path":"src/sizzle.js","user":{"name":"timmywil","email":""}},{"body":"Calling the compiled function manually is dirty.

Consider it the companion method for `compile`. It is a better API.\n\nAs for the performance problem, I agree that reducing the number of loops is the real issue in the use case laid out by the perf. SelectorSet's solution is to group all delegated selectors and only drill down into a particular group after a preliminary short match. Implementing that is a lot more bloat. On top of that, it is completely specialized.\n\nThe other option presented so far is bringing back quickIs, which I don't like because it duplicates selector code and just says to me that Sizzle could do it better. Skipping selector compilation for event delegation is both logical and a performance improvement (I've seen 20x in some tests).

You might want to search your local package\nrepositories before building from source.\n\nIf a binary package isn't available for your computing platform of\nchoice, you can use the following procedure to build the PXSL tools\nfor your platform.\n\nIn order to build the tools you will need the following:\n\n  - A copy of the PXSL source code.  You can get a copy here:\n    https://github.com/tmoertel/pxsl-tools/archive/master.zip\n\n  - A Haskell compiler supporting the Cabal build system.\n    I use GHC:  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/\n\n  - GNU Make (or equivalent)\n\nJust uncompress the tarball and build the project using the following\ncommands.  If you want to install a personal copy of pxslcc instead of\nthe doing the default, system-wide installation, uncomment the extra\ncommand-line flags on the third command.\n\n    $ unzip pxsl-tools-master.zip\n    $ cd pxsl-tools-master\n    $ make\n    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install\n\nThat's it.  You should now have a fully functional version of pxslcc.\n\n\n* Gentle Introduction to PXSL\n\nPXSL (\"pixel\") is a convenient shorthand for writing markup-heavy XML\ndocuments.  This introduction assumes that you are familiar with XML.\nIf you want a refresher, see the introductions on XML available here:\n\n    http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlIntro.html\n\n** Why PXSL ?\n\nXML is a descendant of the markup language SGML and inherits its\nancestor's historical bias toward marking up textual documents.\nHowever, XML is becoming an increasingly popular medium for the\nrepresentation of non-textual information such as metadata (RSS, XSD,\nRELAX-NG), remote procedure calls (SOAP), and even information\nthat looks much like programming languages (XSLT, SVG, MathML).\nFor these uses, XML's text-centric syntax gets in the way.\n\nConsider, for example, this snippet of MathML:\n\n    MathML in XML\n\n    <declare type=\"fn\">\n      <ci> f </ci>\n      <lambda>\n        <bvar><ci> x </ci></bvar>\n        <apply>\n          <plus/>\n          <apply>\n            <power/>\n            <ci> x </ci>\n            <cn> 2 </cn>\n          </apply>\n          <ci> x </ci>\n          <cn> 3 </cn>\n        </apply>\n      </lambda>\n    </declare>\n\nNotice something about MathML's structure: There is more markup than\ntext.  In fact, the only text in the snippet is \"f x x2 x3\"; the rest\nis markup.  As you can see above, XML's document-centric style of\nmarkup, in which the markup is delimited from the flow of surrounding\ntext, becomes a hindrance when markup is in the majority.\n\nPXSL, in contrast, was designed specifically to handle this case well.\nIt makes dense markup easy because it assumes that everything is\nmarkup to begin with.  You need only delimit the few portions of text\nthat are mixed into the flow of surrounding markup.\n\nIn other words, PXSL is what you get when you turn XML inside out:\n\n    XML                             PXSL\n\n    <markup>text</markup>           markup <<text>>\n\nLet's see how this inside-out transformation simplifies our MathML\nexample from above:\n\n    MathML in XML                   MathML in PXSL\n\n    <declare type=\"fn\">             declare -type=fn\n      <ci> f </ci>                    ci << f >>\n      <lambda>                        lambda\n        <bvar><ci> x </ci></bvar>       bvar\n        <apply>                           ci << x >>\n          <plus/>                       apply\n          <apply>                         plus\n            <power/>                      apply\n            <ci> x </ci>                    power\n            <cn> 2 </cn>                    ci << x >>\n          </apply>                          cn << 2 >>\n          <ci> x </ci>                    ci << x >>\n          <cn> 3 </cn>                    cn << 3 >>\n        </apply>\n      </lambda>\n    </declare>\n\nThere are two things to notice about the PXSL version in comparison\nto the XML version.  First, the PXSL version is shorter.  Second, and\nmost important, PXSL is comparatively free of noisy characters like < >\n/ and \".  In PXSL, noise is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n\n** A closer look at PXSL\n\nWriting PXSL is simple.  If you know how to write XML, you can write\nPXSL.  In fact, PXSL is XML, just written in a different, inside-out\nsyntax.  Let's see how it works by way of comparison.\n\nFirst, every XML document and hence every PXSL document has a root\nelement.  Here is a tiny document that has a root element and nothing\nelse:\n\n    XML                             PXSL\n\n    <doc/>                          doc\n\nIf the document contains other elements, they are simply placed\nunderneath the root element, but indented to indicate that the root\nelement contains them.  In XML this indenting is optional, but most\npeople do it anyway because it is an established practice that makes\ndocuments easier to understand.  In PXSL however, the indenting is\nmandatory because indentation determines which elements contain\nothers.  (This requirement is what enables PXSL to do away with the\nclosing tags that XML uses to determine containment.)\n\n    <doc>                           doc\n      <title/>                        title\n      <body/>                         body\n    </doc>\n\nIf an element has attributes, they are written in the form of\n-name=value in PXSL.\n\n    <doc>                           doc\n      <title/>                        title\n      <body id=\"db13\"/>               body -id=db13\n    </doc>\n\nIf an attribute value contains whitespace, it must be quoted within\nthe literal delimiters << and >>.\n\n    <doc keywords=\"x y z\">          doc -keywords=<<x y z>>\n      <title/>                        title\n      <body id=\"db13\"/>               body -id=db13\n    </doc>\n\nNow let's consider text.  If an element contains text, the text is\nquoted in << and >> delimiters and indented underneath the element\nthat owns the text.\n\n    <doc keywords=\"x y z\">          doc -keywords=<<x y z>>\n      <title/>                        title\n      <body id=\"db13\">                body -id=db13\n        This is text.                   <<This is text.>>\n      </body>\n    </doc>\n\nThe << and >> delimiters are powerful.  The text within them,\nincluding all whitespace, is quoted verbatim.  The text can span\nmultiple lines and even stray outside of the outline-like indentation\nhierarchy.  If you place sections of quoted text next to one another\n<<like>> <<so>> they effectively become one section <<likeso>>.\n\n    <doc keywords=\"x y z\">          doc -keywords=<<x y z>>\n      <title>                         title\n        My title                        <<My title>>\n      </title>                        body -id=db13\n      <body id=\"db13\">                  <<This is multi-\n        This is multi-                  line text.>>\n        line text.\n      </body>\n    </doc>\n\nIf you want to add an XML comment, introduce it with the -- delimiter.\nThe comment extends to the end of the line.\n\n    <!-- my document -->            -- my document\n    <doc keywords=\"x y z\">          doc -keywords=<<x y z>>\n      <title>                         title\n        My title                        <<My title>>\n      </title>                        body -id=db13\n      <body id=\"db13\">                  <<This is multi-\n        This is multi-                  line text.>>\n        line text.\n      </body>\n    </doc>\n\nYou can also use the # delimiter, which creates a PXSL comment that is\ninvisible in XML:\n\n    <!-- my document -->            -- my document\n    <doc keywords=\"x y z\">          doc -keywords=<<x y z>>\n      <title>                         title\n        My title                        <<My title>>\n      </title>                        body -id=db13\n      <body id=\"db13\">                  <<This is multi-\n        This is multi-                  line text.>>\n        line text.\n      </body>                       # hidden comment, for\n    </doc>                          # PXSL readers only\n\n\nThat's it.  You now know everything necessary to create PXSL\ndocuments.\n\nPXSL lets you do more, however, and if you want to take full advantage\nof it, read the Advanced Topics section.  For now, though, let's\nconsider how to use PXSL documents with your existing XML-based\nsoftware.\n\n\n** Using PXSL documents\n\nUsing PXSL documents is easy because they are really XML documents in\ndisguise.  (In fact, you may wish to consider PXSL as a convenient\nshorthand for writing XML.)  Any program that can read XML can handle\nPXSL.  All you need to do is remove the disguise first so that the\nprograms will recognize your documents for what they are.\n\nThe included tool pxlscc (short for PXSL conversion compiler) performs\nthis task.  Just feed it a PXSL document, and it returns the\nequivalent plain-old XML document:\n\n    $ pxlscc document.pxsl > document.xml\n\nYou can then use the returned document in your XML-aware programs.\n\nIf you know how to use Make or Ant or similar tools, you can easily\nautomate this process so that your PXSL files are automagically\nconverted into XML when needed.\n\nNOTE:  The pxslcc program expects UTF-8 encoded input and emits UTF-8\nencoded output.\n\n\n* Advanced topics\n\nThe following sections describe the more advanced capabilities of PXSL\nthat can make your life easier.  The element defaults, in particular,\ncan significantly reduce markup burdens.\n\n\n** Element defaults provide convenient, customizable shortcuts\n\nMost XML documents conform to established vocabularies.  Once you\nbecome familiar with your documents' vocabularies, you'll probably\nfind that certain elements and attributes always or often occur\ntogether -- to the point where typing them becomes repetitive.  For\nexample, in XHTML, almost all img elements take the following form:\n\n    <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\" [ additional attributes here ] />\n\nOr, in PXSL:\n\n    img -src=... -alt=... [ additional attributes here ]\n\nSo, why should you have to type in the repetitive src=\"\" and alt=\"\"\nevery time you use an img element?  With PXSL's element defaults,\nyou don't need to.\n\n*** Using element defaults to create attribute shortcuts\n\nElement defaults are shortcuts that are defined in a separate file\nusing a simple syntax.  (For the specifics of creating and loading\nthese files, see the Reference section on pxslcc.)  For example:\n\n    img = img src alt\n\nThis shortcut allows you optionally to leave off the -src= and -alt=\npart whenever you write the PXSL markup for an img element.  For\nexample, with this definition in place, all three of these PXSL\nstatements mean the exact same thing:\n\n    img -src=/images/logo.png -alt=Logo\n    img /images/logo.png -alt=Logo\n    img /images/logo.png Logo\n\nAll of them convert into the same XHTML:\n\n    <img src=\"/images/logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"/>\n    <img src=\"/images/logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"/>\n    <img src=\"/images/logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\"/>\n\nIn other words, shortcuts let you pass attribute values by position\ninstead of by the -name=value syntax.  You provide only the values,\nand the shortcut provides the corresponding -name= parts behind the\nscenes.\n\nBut there are a couple of restrictions to keep in mind.  First,\nattribute values passed by position must come first, before any values\npassed using the -name=value syntax, and they must occur in the same\norder as declared in the shortcut definition.\n\nSecond, you can only pass values this way if they do not contain\nwhitespace.  If a value contains whitespace, you must use the\n-name=value syntax and quote the value: -name=<<my value>> (There is\nan advanced feature, the <( )> delimiters, that overcome this\nrestriction.  They are described in the section on advanced macros,\nlater in this document.)\n\n*** Using element defaults to create virtual elements\n\nYou can also use the element defaults to create your own virtual\nelements.  If you work in XHTML, you have probably noticed that the\n<a> element is used to create both hypertext links and anchors.  For\nexample:\n\n   <a name=\"anchor-name\">Anchored text</a>\n   <a href=\"#anchor-name\">Link to anchored text</a>\n\nWhy not make these two uses more obviously distinct while cutting down\non markup at the same time?  Let's create virtual \"anchor\" and \"hlink\"\nelements that do just that:\n\n   anchor = a name\n   hlink = a href\n\nNow we can use these elements in PXSL to express the above XHTML more\nclearly:\n\n   anchor anchor-name <<Anchored text>>\n   hlink #anchor-name <<Link to anchored text>>\n\n(Notice that we used << and >> in an advanced way that lets us put\nquoted text on the same line as the element that contains it.  This is\ndiscussed further in the \"Advanced quoting\" section.)\n\nWhen we convert the above PXSL into XML, it results in exactly the\nsame XHTML that we discussed earlier:\n\n   <a name=\"anchor-name\">Anchored text</a>\n   <a href=\"#anchor-name\">Link to anchored text</a>\n\n\n*** Making and using your own element defaults\n\nMaking your own shortcuts is easy.  Just create a file that contains\nlines of this form:\n\n    element-name = preferred-element-name opt-attr-1 opt-attr-2 ...\n\nIt's a good idea to extend the file's name with a suffix of \".edf\",\nwhich is short for \"element defaults,\" but feel free to ignore this\nconvention.  (Note: element defaults are *not* PXSL macros.  If you\nwant to create a file that contains commonly used macros, just save\nthem in a regular .pxsl file and include it by mentioning it on the\ncommand line; the .edf suffix is for element defaults only.  See \"Tip:\nstore frequently used macros in separate .pxsl files\" for more.)\n\nFor example, we might create a \"xhtml-shortcuts.edf\" file to capture\nour shortcuts from above:\n\n    # File: xhtml-shortcuts.edf\n\n    anchor = a name\n    hlink = a href\n\n(Notice that you can place comment lines in your .edf files by\nstarting them with a \"#\" character.)\n\nTo use the shortcuts, tell pxslcc to --add them to the set of active\nelement defaults that are used when processing your PXSL files:\n\n    $ pxslcc --add=xhtml-shortcuts.edf my-doc.pxsl > my-doc.xhtml\n\nYou can --add more than one set of defaults, and pxslcc will use them\nall.\n\n*** Built-in element defaults for XSLT stylesheets\n\nPXSL was originally created to reduce the verbosity of XSLT\nstylesheets.  As a result, pxslcc has a built-in set of element\ndefaults for XSLT that you can enable by passing the --xslt\nflag:\n\n    $ pxslcc --xslt stylesheet.pxsl > stylesheet.xsl\n\nThe built-in defaults provide two benefits: First, you can use element\nnames from within the XSLT namespace without having to use the xsl:\nprefix.  Second, you can pass common required attributes like \"select\"\nand \"match\" by position.\n\nTogether, these benefits result in massive markup reductions, making\nyour life as an XSLT author much easier.  Compare the following\nsnippet of XSLT in XML\n\n    <xsl:template match=\"/\">\n      <xsl:for-each select=\"//*/@src|//*/@href\">\n        <xsl:value-of select=\".\"/>\n        <xsl:text>&#10;</xsl:text>\n      </xsl:for-each>\n    </xsl:template>\n\nwith the same snippet rewritten in PXSL (using --xslt defaults):\n\n    template /\n      for-each //*/@src|//*/@href\n        value-of .\n        text <<&#10;>>\n\nAmong the many XSLT shortcuts enabled by the --xslt flag, the above\nPXSL snippet uses the following:\n\n    template = xsl:template match name\n    for-each = xsl:for-each select xml:space\n    value-of = xsl:value-of select disable-output-escaping\n    text     = xsl:text disable-output-escaping\n\nTo see the complete list of XSLT shortcuts, --export them:\n\n    $ pxslcc --xslt --export\n\n\n** Advanced quoting with the << >> and <{ }> delimiters\n\nPXSL has two kinds of quoting delimiters that can be used to quote\nmixed and text-only content.  Both are described in this section.\n\n*** XML quoting << >> delimiters\n\nThe << and >> delimiters not only let you insert text into your PXSL\ndocuments, but also let you insert raw, full-featured XML.  This works\ngreat for those times when it's just easier to write a bit of XML than\nits PXSL equivalent.  For example, if you're writing an XSLT\nstylesheet that generates XHTML output, you'll certainly want to use\nPXSL to express the markup-dense xsl:stylesheet directives.  But, if\nyou need to drop in some XHTML boilerplate that a designer gave you to\nuse in the page footer, just copy-and-paste it using << and >>:\n\n    <<\n       <div class=\"footer\">\n       Copyright (C) 2003 Blah, Blah, Blah, Inc.\n       <!--  lots more boilerplate ... -->\n       </div>\n    >>\n\nAnother great use for the << >> delimiters is to drop XML specials\nlike processing instructions into your code:\n\n    <<<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>>>\n\nThe above PXSL is equivalent to the following XML:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n\nBecause the << >> delimiters quote XML, you must follow XML's\nsyntactical rules when using them.  That means that if you\nwant to include literal less-than \"<\" and ampersand \"&\"\ncharacters, you must use character entity references:\n\n    << less-than: &lt; >>\n    << ampersand: &amp; >>\n\n*** Verbatim text <{ }> delimiters (CDATA)\n\nWhen copy-and-pasting blocks of text from outside sources, you must be\ncareful to \"escape\" any literal \"<\" and \"&\" characters that may be\nwithin.  This can be annoying, especially for large blocks of text.\nAnother place where this requirement is burdensome is in mathematical\nexpressions that sometimes occur in XSLT markup:\n\n    xsl:test -when=<< $i &lt; 5 >>\n\nFor this reason, PXSL provides the verbatim-text delimiters <{ and }>\nthat perform the same function as XML's more verbose CDATA delimiters:\n\n    XML                                   PXSL\n\n    <![CDATA[ toast & jelly ]]>           <{ toast & jelly }>\n\nAny characters that you place inside of <{ }> will come out as a\ncharacter literals.  PXSL will take care of any escaping that is\nnecessary to prevent XML from misinterpreting your text as markup.\nFor example, we can rewrite the above XSLT snippet more clearly\nusing the verbatim-text delimiters:\n\n    xsl:test -when=<{ $i < 5 }>\n\nThese delimiters are especially handy for including examples of XML\nmarkup in your documents.  Like << >>, <{ }> can handle large blocks\nof multi-line text and preserves whitespace and indentation.\n\n*** Text-content shortcut\n\nAs you may have noticed from the MathML example at the beginning of\nthis document, if an element contains text, you can declare the\ntext on the same line as the element.  This saves space and often\nreads more easily:\n\n    NORMAL                         SHORTCUT\n\n    h1                             h1 <<Chapter 1>>\n      <<Chapter 1>>                h2 <{Sections 1 & 2}>\n    h2\n      <{Sections 1 & 2}>\n\n\n** Macro facility\n\nPXSL has a simple macro facility that you can use to reorganize your\nmarkup and \"factor out\" boilerplate.  A macro is defined with a\nleading comma and a trailing equals sign, like so:\n\n    ,name =\n        body-of-the-macro\n\nwhere \"name\" is the name of the macro and \"body-of-the-macro\" can be\nany series of elements and text.  Macros can be defined at any level\nof nesting within a PXSL document, but they are only visible (i.e.,\navailable for use) at the level where they were defined and at levels\nnested underneath.  (If two macros with the same name are visible at\nthe same time, the deepest one will hide the other, or if both are on\nthe same level, the one defined latest in the document will hide the\nearlier.  In other words, the policy is \"the last, deepest one wins.\")\n\n*** Using macros (i.e., macro expansion)\n\nTo use a macro, simply refer to it by name anywhere that an element\ncan be used:\n\n    ,hello =\n      <<Hello!>>\n\n    html\n      head\n        title\n          ,hello\n      body\n        <<Hello! Again!>>\n\nWhen processed with pxslcc (using the --indent flag), this is the\nresult:\n\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <title>Hello!</title>\n      </head>\n      <body>Hello! Again!</body>\n    </html>\n\nNote that the macro definition has been removed and that the reference\nto the macro inside of the \"title\" element has been replaced by the\nmacro's body.  This is called macro expansion.\n\nMacros don't need to be defined before they are expanded, as long as\nthey are visible from the sites (locations) where they are expanded.\nAlso, macros can call other macros:\n\n    ,hello =\n      <<Hello!>>\n\n    html\n      ,head\n      ,body\n\n      ,head =\n         head\n          title\n            ,hello\n\n      ,body =\n        body <<Hello! Again!>>\n\nThis snippet results in exactly the same XML as the one above.\nNevertheless, we have made a number of organizational changes.\nThe \"head\" and \"body\" within the \"html\" element have been\nfactored out into the macros ,head and ,body and relocated within\nthe document.  These macros are defined within the \"html\"\nelement, after the sites where they are expanded.  Note that the\n,head macro calls upon the ,hello macro that we defined earlier.\n\nAlthough contrived in this small example, factoring out blocks of\nmarkup makes the structure of large documents easier to understand and\nmanage because you are free to move them around, subdivide them\nfurther, and reuse them in many locations.\n\n*** Tip: store frequently used macros in reusable .pxsl files\n\nIf you use certain macros frequently in your PXSL documents, you might\nbenefit from placing the macros into a separate .pxsl file that you\ncan reuse.  For example, you could place your macros into a file\nmacros.pxsl and then use them when processing several documents:\n\n    $ pxslcc macros.pxsl doc1.pxsl > doc1.xml\n    $ pxslcc macros.pxsl doc2.pxsl > doc2.xml\n    $ pxslcc macros.pxsl doc3.pxsl > doc3.xml\n\n\n*** Parameterized macros\n\nMacros can take any number of parameters, which allows you to customize\ntheir definitions.\n\n**** Using named parameters\n\nFor example, we could customize the definition of the ,head macro that\nwe used above to accept the title as a parameter:\n\n    ,make-head my-title =\n       head\n        title\n          ,my-title\n\nNow we can use it to create a head element that contains any title\nthat we want:\n\n    ,make-head -my-title=<<This is my title.>>\n\nNote that we pass parameters to a macro just like we pass attributes\nto an element definition.\n\n**** Using the magic, implicit BODY parameter\n\nBut what if we want to pass more than strings?  What if we want to\npass large sections of documents as parameters?  We can do this using\nthe special BODY parameter that all macros have implicitly:\n\n    ,make-section title =\n      section\n        -- start of section\n        title\n          ,title\n        ,BODY\n        -- end of section\n\n(Note that the BODY parameter must be spelled exactly \"BODY\" and in\nall caps.)  The BODY parameter accepts any content defined underneath\nthe macro-expansion site (i.e., the body of the macro-expansion\ninvocation):\n\n    ,make-section -title=<<This is my title>>\n      p <<This is a paragraph.>>\n      p <<And another.>>\n      p <<And so on.>>\n\nThe result of calling this macro is the following XML:\n\n    <section>\n      <!-- start of section -->\n      <title>This is my title</title>\n      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n      <p>And another.</p>\n      <p>And so on.</p>\n      <!-- end of section -->\n    </section>\n\n*** Advanced macros and passing parameters with the <( )> delimiters\n\nAs we showed earlier, one way of passing document fragments to macros\nis via the implicit BODY parameter that all macros have.  Another is\nto pass them as normal arguments using the <( )> delimiters, which let\nyou group PXSL document fragments into chunks that you can pass as\narguments.\n\nFor example, let's redefine the make-section macro we defined above to\naccept the body of the section as a normal parameter:\n\n    ,make-section title body =\n      section\n        -- start of section\n        title\n          ,title\n        body\n          ,body\n        -- end of section\n\nNow we can call it like so:\n\n    ,make-section -title=<<This is my title>> \\\n      -body=<(\n        p <<This is a paragraph.>>\n        p <<And another.>>\n        p <<And so on.>>\n      )>\n\n(Note the use of the backslash in between parameters to continue the\nparameter list to the next line.  This useful trick also works to\ncontinue attribute lists when you are creating elements.)\n\nBecause the <( )> delimiters can be used only to pass arguments, you\ncan use them to \"quote\" arguments that otherwise could not be passed\nvia position, e.g., a fragment of text that contains whitespace:\n\n    ,make-section <( <<This is my title>> )> \\\n      <(\n        p <<This is a paragraph.>>\n        p <<And another.>>\n        p <<And so on.>>\n      )>\n\nYou can even use the <( )> delimiters to pass the results of macro\ncalls to elements and other macros:\n\n    ,h1 x =\n      -- level one heading\n      h1\n        ,x\n\n    ,bang x =\n      ,x\n      <<!>>\n\n    ,h1 <( <<Hello, >>\n           ,bang World )>\n\nThe above produces the following XML:\n\n    <!-- level one heading -->\n    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n\n\n*** More advanced macros and functional programming\n\nLike functions in functional programming languages, macros in PXSL are\nfirst-class values that can be created, bound to parameters, and\npassed to other macros.  While this might initially seem like a\nprogramming-language curiosity, it is actually a simple yet immensely\npowerful tool that you can use to reduce the size and complexity of\nyour XML documents.  In particular, this tool lets you \"factor out\"\nand reuse common, boilerplate portions of your documents.\n\nTo see how this works, consider the following XML document that\nrepresents an address book:\n\n    <address-book>\n      <person>\n        <first>Joe</first>\n        <last>Smith</last>\n        <preferred>Joe Smith</preferred>\n      </person>\n      <person>\n        <first>John</first>\n        <last>Doe</last>\n        <preferred>John Doe</preferred>\n      </person>\n      <!-- ... more persons ... -->\n    </address-book>\n\nThe address book contains a long list of persons, each of which has a\nfirst and last name and a \"preferred name\" that is usually the first\nand last named joined together (but might be something else).\n\nWe might write the address book in PXSL like this:\n\n    address-book\n      person\n        first <<Joe>>\n        last <<Smith>>\n        preferred <<Joe Smith>>\n      person\n        first <<John>\n        last <<Doe>>\n        preferred <<John Doe>>\n      -- ... more persons ...\n\nBut, seeing how repetitive that is, we might create a ,person macro\nto make our lives easier:\n\n    ,person first last =\n      person\n        first\n          ,first\n        last\n          ,last\n        preferred\n          ,first\n          << >>\n          ,last\n\nNow, with our new macro, we can simply write\n\n    address-book\n      ,person Joe Smith\n      ,person John Doe\n      -- ... more persons ...\n\nAnd, indeed, running the above PXSL code through pxslcc, yields the\nidentical XML:\n\n    <address-book>\n      <person>\n        <first>Joe</first>\n        <last>Smith</last>\n        <preferred>Joe Smith</preferred>\n      </person>\n      <person>\n        <first>John</first>\n        <last>Doe</last>\n        <preferred>John Doe</preferred>\n      </person>\n      <!-- ... more persons ... -->\n    </address-book>\n\nAlready, we have saved a great deal of work, but let's say that the\nsituation is a little more complicated.  Let's say that in addition\nto the address-book, we also need to make a roster of persons:\n\n    <roster>\n      <formal>Smith, Joe</formal>\n      <formal>Doe, John</formal>\n      <!-- ... more persons ... -->\n    </roster>\n\nand, most important, we need to keep the address-book and roster\nsynchronized.  In other words, we have one list of names and we\nmust use it in two places.\n\nAt this point, we might be tempted to put the list of names in a\nseparate XML document and write a small external program or a couple\nof XSLT stylesheets to transform the document into the address-book\nand roster.  After all, we don't want to have to keep the address-book\nand roster synchronized by hand.\n\nBut we can do this without leaving PXSL.  All we have to do is create\na macro that builds things out of our list of people:\n\n    ,build-from-people builder-macro =\n        ,builder-macro Joe Smith\n        ,builder-macro John Doe\n        -- ... more persons ...\n\nThe interesting thing is that our ,build-from-people macro takes\nanother macro as a parameter and binds it to the name \"builder-macro\",\njust like it would any other kind of parameter.  It uses this macro to\ntransform a first and last name into something else.  What that\nsomething else is, is up to us: We simply tailor the ,builder-macro to\nsuit our purpose.\n\nFor example, to build an address book:\n\n    address-book\n      ,build-from-people <( , first last =\n                              ,person <(,first)> <(,last)> )>\n\nor, to build a roster:\n\n    roster\n      ,build-from-people <( , first last =\n                              formal\n                                ,last\n                                <<, >>\n                                ,first  )>\n\nThat's it.  We have just built an address book and a roster from our\nlist of people.\n\nNow, you may have noticed something new in the above two snippets of\nPXSL.  In each snippet, inside of the outer-most <( )> delimiters, we\ncreated a macro on the fly -- an anonymous macro, so called because we\ndidn't give it a name.  (It doesn't need a name because we're using it\njust this one time; nobody else will ever call it.)  We simply created\nit right when we needed it and passed it to the ,build-from-people\nmacro, where it was bound to the name \"builder-macro.\" Then\n,build-from-people used it to construct \"person\" or \"formal\" elements\n(depending on how we defined the anonymous macro).  It's a pretty neat\ntrick.\n\nYou can create anonymous macros using the familiar comma syntax --\njust don't provide a name.  Note the space between the comma and the\nstart of the argument list:\n\n    , arg1 arg2... =\n      body\n\nTo call an anonymous macro, of course, you'll first have to bind it to\na name.  The way you do this is to pass the anonymous macro to another\nmacro, just like we did earlier, causing the anonymous macro to be\nbound to one of the other macro's parameters:\n\n    ,some-other-macro <( , arg1 arg2... =\n                           body  )>\n\nThen that other macro can call it via the parameter's name:\n\n    ,some-other-macro marco-arg =\n      ,macro-arg -arg1=... -arg2=...\n\nHere's another example, less practical but illustrative.  See if you\ncan figure out how the code works before reading the explanation\nthat follows.\n\n    ,double str =\n       <{\"}>\n       ,str\n       <{\"}>\n    ,single str =\n       <{'}>\n       ,str\n       <{'}>\n    ,add-quotes quote-fn str =\n       ,quote-fn <( ,str )>\n\n    -- let's quote a couple of strings\n\n    ,add-quotes <( , x = ,double <(,x)> )> -str=<<Quote Me>>\n    << >>\n    ,add-quotes <( , x = ,single <(,x)> )> Please!\n\nPxslcc compiles the above into the following output:\n\n    <!-- let's quote a couple of strings -->\n\n    \"Quote Me\" 'Please!'\n\nIn this example, the two calls to the ,add-quotes macro each pass in\nan anonymous macro that performs the desired quoting operation.  The\nanonymous macro is bound to \"quote-fn\" when the ,add-quotes macro is\ncalled and expanded.  Thus, when ,add-quotes calls ,quote-fn, it is\nreally calling the anonymous macro that we passed to it.  This lets us\ncustomize the behavior of ,add-quotes without having to rewrite it.\n\n*** Real-world example\n\nThe examples above are contrived and don't do justice to the\nusefulness of this tool.  This type of refactoring shines when dealing\nwith large, complicated, and repetitive data structures, but such\nexamples are too unwieldy to include in an introduction like this.\nFor this reason, I urge you to take a look at the\n\"xsl-menus-w-macros.pxsl\" example, in examples directory.  It shows\none way that you can use anonymous macros to factor out common code in\nproduction XSLT stylesheets.\n\n    https://github.com/tmoertel/pxsl-tools/blob/master/examples/xsl-menus-w-macros.pxsl\n\n** Automatic PXSL-to-XML conversion via Make\n\nMost Make utilities allow you to define pattern rules that are then\nused automatically to convert one class of documents into another.\nPattern rules can be used to automate the conversion of PXSL documents\ninto their XML counterparts.  For example, if you place the following\nrule into a makefile (this is for GNU make),\n\n    %.xml: %.pxsl\n            pxlscc --indent=2 --header $< > $@\n\nMake will automatically generate .xml documents from the\ncorresponding .pxsl documents whenever they are needed.  This\nfrees you to substitute .pxsl documents anywhere that your\nproject calls for .xml documents, knowing that make will keep all\nof the .xml documents up to date, regenerating them as needed\nwhen you update your .pxsl documents.\n\n\n* Reference:  pxlscc\n\n  Usage: pxslcc [OPTION...] [file...]\n  -i[NUM]  --indent[=NUM]  Re-indent XML using NUM spaces per nesting level\n  -h       --header        Insert edit-the-PXSL-instead header into output XML\n  -x       --xslt          Add XSLT defaults\n  -a FILE  --add=FILE      Add the given defaults file\n           --export        Export (print) all of the active defaults\n           --dump          Dump internal parse format (for debugging)\n\nWhen you list more than one PXSL file on the command line, pxslcc will\njoin the files, in order, into one big PXSL document and process that\ndocument.  You can use this feature to incorporate commonly used\nmacros into your documents:\n\n    $ pxslcc macros1.pxsl macros2.pxsl doc.pxsl > doc.xml\n\nIn the example above, doc.pxsl can use the macros defined in\nmacros1.pxsl and macros2.pxsl.\n\nThe --header option requires some explanation.  It inserts the following\nheader comment into the output XML:\n\n    <!--\n\n    NOTICE:  This XML document was generated from PXSL source.\n             If you want to edit this file, you should probably\n             edit the original PXSL source file instead.\n\n    -->\n\nIt's a good idea to use the --header option all of the time.  This\nprevents you (or somebody else) from accidentally editing an XML file\nwhen you really ought to be editing the PXSL file from which the\nXML file is generated.\n\n\n[TODO: Expand this section]\n\n\n* Reference:  PXSL syntax\n\nThe PXSL grammar, in EBNF-like notation:\n\n    pxsl-document       ::= statement*, EOF\n\n    statement           ::= pxsl-comment\n                          | xml-comment\n                          | literal-constructor\n                          | element-constructor\n                          | macro-def\n                          | macro-app\n\n    pxsl-comment        ::= '#',  all-text-until-newline, NEWLINE\n    xml-comment         ::= \"--\", all-text-until-newline, NEWLINE\n    literal-constructor ::= mixed-literal | cdata-literal\n    element-constructor ::= xml-name, posn-args, nv-args, children\n    macro-def           ::= ',', xml-name?, param-names, '=', macro-body\n    macro-app           ::= ',', xml-name, posn-args, nv-args, children\n\n    xml-name            ::= ( LETTER | '_' | ':' ),\n                            ( LETTER | DIGIT | '_' | ':' | '.' | '-' )*\n    posn-args           ::= expr-list\n    nv-args             ::= ( line-continuation?, name-value-pair )*\n    name-value-pair     ::= '-', xml-name, '=', expr\n    children            ::= statement*     /* must be indented */\n    macro-body          ::= children\n    param-names         ::= ( line-continuation?, xml-name )*\n\n    line-continuation   ::= '\\', newline\n\n    expr-list           ::= ( line-continuation?, arg-expr )*\n    arg-expr            ::= expr    /* cannot start with '-' */\n    expr                ::= expr-single | NON-WHITESPACE+\n    expr-single         ::= mixed-literal | cdata-literal | pxsl-fragment\n    mixed-literal       ::= \"<<\", all-text-until->>-delimiter, \">>\"\n    cdata-literal       ::= \"<{\", all-text-until-}>-delimiter, \"}>\"\n    pxsl-fragment       ::= \"<(\", statement*, \")>\"\n\n\n* Authors\n\nTom Moertel <tom@moertel.com> http://blog.moertel.com/\n\nBill Hubauer <bill@hubauer.com>\n\n* (For Emacs)\n\n  Local Variables:\n  mode:outline\n  End:\n","language":[{"lang":"Haskell","bytes":33491},{"lang":"XSLT","bytes":1950},{"lang":"Perl","bytes":1842}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Makefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Setup.lhs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"TODO","type":"Blob"},{"path":"examples","type":"Tree"},{"path":"examples/xsl-menus-w-macros.pxsl","type":"Blob"},{"path":"pxsl-tools.cabal","type":"Blob"},{"path":"pxsl-tools.spec.in","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/GetInput.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltElementDefaults.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltFormat.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltMacros.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltParser.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltParserTerms.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/PxsltParserTreeTransforms.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/UTF8.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/XmlString.hs","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/pxslcc.hs.in","type":"Blob"},{"path":"text-to-html.pl","type":"Blob"},{"path":"xsl2pxsl.xsl","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Update build system for newer Cabal version"},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tmoertel@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tmoertel@gmail.com"},"message":"Update README to remove stale links"},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Removed Makefile from Cabal dist because its presense might confuse folks."},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Renamed pxslcc.cabl to pxsl-tools.cabal to satisfy Hackage."},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Moved README into Cabal data-file section so cabal-rpm will pacakge it."},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Removed old ChangeLog (use \"git log\" instead)."},"author_login":"tmoertel","committer_login":"tmoertel"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Tom Moertel","email":"tom@moertel.com"},"message":"Bumped version to 1.0.1;

make test\n    make install\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENCE\n\nCopyright (C) 2005 Shawn Sorichetti\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the same terms as Perl

plugin that interfaces with the Errorlytics service.","readme":"= Errolytics Plugin for Rails\n\nThe Errorlytics plugin provides an interface to the Errorlytics system\n(http://www.errorlytics.com).  Errorlytics is an easy to use service that\ncentralizes reporting and handling of 404 \"Page Not Found\" errors for your\nwebsites. Errorlytics gives you the tools to transparently fix the problems\nquickly and easily so they never happen again. No more regex writing, no more\nmessing with your .htaccess file for search engine friendly redirects.\nErrorlytics handles it all, effortlessly. The end results are better user\nexperiences and higher search engine rankings for your websites.\n\n== Installation\n\nIf using Rails 2.1 or later the Rails Errorlytics plugin can be installed by\nissuing the command:\n\nscript/plugin install git://github.com/dburger/errorlytics-rails-plugin.git\n\nIf you are using an older version of rails you can clone this repository into\nyour vendor/plugins directory and then remove the .git subdirectory:\n\ngit clone git://github.com/dburger/errorlytics-rails-plugin.git vendor/rails/errorlytics\nrm -rf vendor/rails/errorlytics/.git\n\n== Configuration\n\nTo configure Errolytics you need to set the secret key, account id, and\nwebsite id.  A good place to put this configuration would be in an\ninitializer or in your environment.  For example you could have a\nconfig/initializers/errorlytics.rb file similar to the following:\n\nErrorlytics.secret_key = 'YOUR SECRET KEY';\nErrorlytics.account_id = 'YOUR ACCOUNT ID';\nErrorlytics.website_id = 'YOUR WEBSITE ID';\n\nThe correct values for these settings can be find on the \"Rails\" tab of\nthe \"Client Plugins\" section for the website you are configuring.\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Accession Media, released under the MIT

I wish to be able to take a .WAV file and split it into\ntiny chunks by breaking on silence, as gramofile does, but with the parameters\nset in such a way that most segments are just a few seconds long for most audio\nsources.

With this\nprogram you can record audio of (for example) gramophone records, process\nthe signal and listen to the results. Because sound files of the\n.WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files with many other\nprograms. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these, so you can make\nCDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user interface of\nGramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it fairly easy to use.\n\nOne of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process\ndigital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it is\npossible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like ticks\nand scratches. These filters have been programmed in such a fashion that\nthey can be applied in a random order (and multiple times) in a single\nrun, thus evading the use of temporary files. There is a possibility of\nadjusting the properties of each filter independently, so in every\nsituation an optimal result can be achieved.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav file\nof an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where the individual\ntracks are located. This happens fully automatically, without need to set\nany options. More experienced users may fine-tune the algorithm, or change\nthe detected track starts and ends, but generally that will not be\nnecessary. Track-times are saved in an editable (plaintext) .tracks file,\nthat will be used during the signal processing to produce one processed\n.wav file for each individual track.\n\nTo record and play .wav files, modified versions of brec(1) and bplay(1) \nby David Monro are used. These programs provide buffered recording and\nplayback, so all will go well even on a highly loaded system. Both\nprograms have been supplied with the standard GramoFile user interface. \nBrec also got a `graphical' peak level meter, and bplay a running time\ndisplay. \n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nThe file gramofile-1.6.tar.gz, available at\n\n    http://panic.et.tudelft.nl/~costar/gramofile/\n\ncontains the complete C source code of the GramoFile program. To unzip it,\ntype\n\n    tar xzvf gramofile-1.6.tar.gz\n\nor, alternatively,\n\n    gunzip gramofile-1.6.tar.gz\n    tar xvf gramofile-1.6.tar\n\nChange the working directory to the newly created directory gramofile-1.6\nand issue the command\n\n    make\n\nto start the compilation process. \n\n\nNote for all 64-bit systems: when your `long'-type vars are 64 bit, .wav\nheaders are not read/written correctly (=bug). If you replace every `long'\nwith an `int' (or other 32-bit type), everything should be fine. \n\nNote for non-Linux systems (like IRIX): check the Makefile first, you\nprobably have to uncomment some lines. Also, you probably won't have sound\nrecording/playing capabilities. If you experience portability problems,\nplease fix them and send me a nice patch ;-) \n\nNote for Solaris: there seem to be problems with the scandir() function\nnot being present. It might be in the \"SunOS/BSD Compatibility Library\"\n(don't ask me...)\nUpdate: there is a scandir replacement in sun_scandir.c. To use it, add it\nto SRCS in the Makefile; also add a line\n  int alphasort(struct dirent **d1, struct dirent **d2);\nin the beginning of dirfilemenu.c.\n\n\nNote that the Makefile is written especially for use with GNU `make'\n(sometimes called `gmake'). That `make' implementation regards #included\nfiles as targets, enabling us to create and include dependency information\nin the same run as compiling the program. That's also the reason why those\n\"file not found\" messages appear: these files will be made and included\nautomatically. More information on the GNU programs may be acquired by\npointing your browser to http://www.gnu.org. If you don't have the GNU\nversion of `make', you can simply comment the `include' line out; it is\nprimarily useful during development activities.\n\nTo run the GramoFile program, issue the command\n\n    gramofile\n\n\nUSAGE NOTES\n\nGeneral:\n - The GramoFile program uses customized versions of `bplay' and `brec',\n    named `bplay_gramo' and `brec_gramo'. These programs are started\n    from within the `gramofile' program with just that names (no\n    directories). That means that they should be located in a directory\n    that is in your search path ($PATH), e.g. /usr/local/bin. But if\n    you don't want (or are not allowed) to put them there, add `.'\n    (current directory) to your search path, set your working directory to\n    the GramoFile directory and start the program with just `gramofile'\n    (the './' as in `./gramofile' should not be necessary). Note: this\n    is a known bug (if you like, send me a nice patch ;-).\n - Information on CD burning issues may be found on:\n    http://www.fokus.gmd.de/nthp/employees/schilling/cdb.html\n\nRecord an audio file: \n - Use the `Mixer' button in the file selection screen to start\n    xmixer(1). Make sure the appropriate input (and no other) is selected\n    for recording. SoundBlaster(TM) owners: note that treble and bass\n    settings affect recording! I found SB16PnP works better with both\n    sliders at 50%, Richard Robinson reports his SB64Gold requires treble\n    65%, bass 45%.\n - If you choose `Cancel' during the \"Press Enter to start recording\" box,\n    the selected audio file has already been created/truncated, and will\n    have zero length. So if you were overwriting a file, it was already\n    deleted before this dialog box appeared.\n - The length as reported in the .wav header of the recorded file is not\n    correct. This is because brec doesn't update the header if the\n    recording was stopped prematurely (by pressing Enter). If you have\n    problems with this, simply process the sound file with the `Copy Only'\n    filter; the output file has the correct length in the .wav header.\n    Alternatively, you can make some additions to the bplay/brec source\n    code...\n - To get the best out of track location, you shouldn't record too much\n    silence before the first & after the last track. 3-5 seconds silence\n    will probably get the best results. Also, I don't recommend recording\n    two sides of a record in a single (long) sound file; make two files\n    instead.\n - If you want to view the input signal level without recording to a\n    sound file, try recording to /dev/null ;-)\n\nCopy audio from an audio-CD to a file:\n - This option is not yet implemented. There are some plans to program a\n    uniform user interface to the cdda2wav(1) program here. You have to\n    use the bare program for this moment. More info:\n    ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/cdda2wav\n    Alternatively, you can try the cdparanoia(1) program:\n    http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/user/xiphmont/cdparanoia/\n\nTrack location: \n - Track location information is saved in a plaintext file with the same\n    name as the audio file but appended with \".tracks\", as in\n    \"firaru_side1.wav.tracks\". You may view/use/edit this file as you\n    please. \n - The \".tracks\" file will be written in the same directory as the sound\n    file. If that directory is not writable, create a symlink to the\n    sound file from a directory like \"/tmp/gramofile\", and use that `new'\n    sound file instead. \n - For more information on the algorithms used, and the procedure you\n    should follow to get optimal track location, see the Tracksplit2.txt\n    file.\n - If you want to view the (optionally generated) .med or .sor files with\n    gnuplot, you may use a gnuplot-command like:\n          plot '/dir/filename.wav.med' using 2 smooth unique\n    or to view only a certain interval:\n          plot [1000:2000] '/dir/filename.wav.med' using 2 smooth unique\n\nProcess the audio signal:\n - If you choose to split tracks, numbered files will be created with the\n    `output filename' as base. If the `output filename' is entered as\n    \"/tmp/test.wav\", files like \"/tmp/test01.wav\", \"/tmp/test02.wav\", etc. \n    will be created. You will be warned if a file \"/tmp/test.wav\" exists,\n    although it will not be overwritten, but the 01, 02, etc. files will\n    be overwritten without your consent. Be warned! (This is also a bug.)\n - You can also pipe the output data directly to some command that accepts\n    .wav-format input via stdin, when using a \"filename\" like\n    `|progname args outfile.ext'. Popular example: `|bladeenc -quiet STDIN\n    processed.mp3'. If track splitting is done, there _must_ be something\n    like a filename at the end of the line; e.g. the `.mp3' will be\n    replaced by `01.wav', `02.wav' etc. (Always `.wav', this is a bug.)\n    A new command is executed for each track. Note: 1) if the name can't\n    be the last item on the line, write a shell-script wrapper; 2) the\n    output file must be read once and in-order, which some programs (like\n    LAME!) can't do. Easily fixed with a script that first saves the data\n    to a .wav tempfile, then performs the wanted action, and finally removes\n    the tempfile.\n - For more information on some of the implemented filtering algorithms,\n    and the implementation of new filters, see the Signproc.txt file. \n - Known problem: the algorithm for the Conditional Median Filter II is not\n    optimal. With certain musical instruments and tones, the sound might\n    get distorted by an annoying `shot noise'. This is because those\n    instruments produce sawtooth-like sound waves, containing lots of high\n    frequencies. The `normal' highpass filter used by the CMF II detects\n    these high frequencies as ticks. You can solve this problem in two\n    ways. First, you may try to increase the tick detection threshold\n    (second threshold) to for example 7000 or higher. Second, you can try\n    to use an alternative highpass filter, by #defineing either FOURTH_ORDER\n    or SIXTH_ORDER in signpr_cmf2.c. These highpasses enhance very high\n    frequencies, so real (short) ticks are detected better, even when using\n    higher thresholds.\n - Hint: if you are doing mono 78's, it might be profitable to use a\n    convert-to-mono filter first. You'll still get a stereo output file,\n    but with both channels identical. Use sox(1) or the like to convert it\n    to a real mono file.\n\nWrite an audio CD: \n - This option is not yet implemented. There are some plans to program a\n    uniform user interface to the cdrecord(1) program here. You have to\n    use the bare program for this moment. Try something like\n\n    cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,2,0 -audio -pad track01.wav track02.wav ... \n\n    Actual information on cdrecord may be found on:\n    http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/\n                                     joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html\n\n    If you like a graphical front-end to write CD's, try the xcdroast\n    program:\n    http://www.fh-muenchen.de/rz/xcdroast\n    (Note: you may have to use the wav2cdr utility.)\n\nPlay an audio file: \n - Make sure the PCM and Master volumes are set high enough, and your\n    speakers are plugged in correctly and turned on ;-)\n - I find the `Track' field to be extremely useful. If I've had located\n    tracks, I use one xterm with GramoFile, and another one with a editor\n    with the .tracks file. If I don't agree with the automatic detection,\n    I change the .tracks file, save it, and listen to the new beginning\n    and end in GramoFile. Note that the .tracks file is reread every time\n    you press B, E, F, A or Enter.\n - To notice differences between filtered/non-filtered sound files, you've\n    got to have speakers that are fit for that purpose. I've found that big\n    speakers are quite `slow' and have a natural ability to reduce tick\n    volume, because they can't keep up with the speed. To be able to hear\n    the ticks as they are, little speakers are most useful, but small,\n    \"low-quality\" headphones (as used with cheap portable audio) are even\n    better.\n\nBUGS\n\nPlenty. Like max string lengths, un-free-d memory, bad error-handling. But\nif you don't do too extraordinary things, you shouldn't notice anything. \nThe source code is definitely not portable (well, IRIX runs fine...). \nThere is no manpage. There are no commandline options - so why bother\nabout a manpage? Only text mode.  Screensize is always 80x24. Only\nCD-quality .wav files are accepted (well, that was the purpose, wasn't\nit?). There are major language errors everywhere (please send me\ncorrections). `make install' doesn't work. \n\nBut I expect too have only very limited time to do something about all\nthem bugs. You may report bugs at any time, direct them to\nJ.A.Bezemer@ITS.TUDelft.NL. Completely worked out fixes are greatly\nappreciated ;-) \n\n\nAUTHORS\n\nGramoFile was developed by Anne Bezemer and Ton Le, students of the\ndepartment of Information Technology and Systems (ITS), sub-department of\nElectrical Engineering (ET) of the Delft University of Technology (TU\nDelft). The first major part was written during the `Integraal Project\nPracticum' (IPP) in the spring of 1998. However, development has continued\nunofficially thereafter (so now we have track splitting operational :).\nTotal development time is about 7 weeks full-time. \n\nThe following persons have been very helpful and/or supportive during the\n`official' part of the project: A.P. Thijssen, E.A. Hendriks, A. Redert,\nJ.A.H. Snelders, L. Meijs and R.J. de Gruijl. Other persons are mentioned\nin the ChangeLog file. \n\nAny questions, comments, suggestions and bugfixes may be mailed to\nJ.A.Bezemer@ITS.TUDelft.NL (or try costar@panic.et.tudelft.nl or\nmcbzmr@dds.nl). But please understand that I'm a student with very limited\ntime to do the more pleasant things in life.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n--\nAll mentioned trademarks and registered trademarks are the property of their\nrespective owners. \n","language":[{"lang":"C","bytes":109531}],"repository":[{"path":"COPYING","type":"Blob"},{"path":"ChangeLog","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Makefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Signpr_cmf3.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Signproc.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"TODO","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Tracksplit.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Tracksplit2.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"fmtheaders.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"gramofile.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"scrollmenu.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"secshms.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"secshms.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf2.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf2.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf3.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_cmf3.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_copy.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_copy.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_doubmed.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_doubmed.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_exper.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_exper.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_general.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_general.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_l1fit.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_l1fit.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_main.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_main.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_mean.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_mean.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_median.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_median.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_mono.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_mono.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_rms.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_rms.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_wav.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"signpr_wav.h","type":"Blob"},{"path":"split-mp3","type":"Blob"},{"path":"split-wav","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tracksplit.c","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tracksplit.h","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Rick Bradley","email":"rick@rickbradley.com"},"commiter":{"name":"Rick Bradley","email":"rick@rickbradley.com"},"message":"Importing to git."},"author_login":"rick","committer_login":"rick"}],"comments":[],"issue":[]},{"id":45589,"name":"gpquiz","full_name":"ylynfatt/gpquiz","owner_id":19831,"description":"A bible quiz application","readme":"/******************************************************************************\nGod's Porch Quiz\n\n@created 08.2008\n@author Yannick Lyn Fatt\n\n******************************************************************************/\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPurpose\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe purpose of this application is twofold.

interface.\n","language":[{"lang":"ActionScript","bytes":105395},{"lang":"JavaScript","bytes":100196},{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":1271}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README.textile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bin","type":"Tree"},{"path":"bin/FQuery.swc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"docs","type":"Tree"},{"path":"docs/.DS_Store","type":"Blob"},{"path":"docs/jquery","type":"Tree"},{"path":"docs/jquery/jquery-1.2.6.js","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/errors","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/errors/AssertionFailedError.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/errors/ClassNotFoundError.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/errors/InstanceNotFoundError.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/errors/UnimplementedFeatureError.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/Assert.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/AsynchronousTestCase.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/AsynchronousTestCaseExample.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/RemotingTestCase.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/Test.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestCase.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestCaseExample.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestFailure.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestListener.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestMethod.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestResult.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/framework/TestSuite.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/runner","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/runner/BaseTestRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/runner/TestSuiteLoader.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/runner/Version.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui/FlexRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui/FlexTestRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui/ResultPrinter.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui/TestRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/textui/XMLResultPrinter.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/util","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/util/ArrayIterator.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/util/Iterator.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/asunit3/asunit/util/Properties.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"rakefile.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"script","type":"Tree"},{"path":"script/generate","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/$.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/FQuery.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/FQueryExample.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/FQueryRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/FQueryXMLRunner.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/collection","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/collection/DisplayListIterator.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/collection/DisplayObjectIterator.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/collection/Iterator.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/display","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/display/Displayable.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/errors","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/errors/FQueryError.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/laml","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/laml/LAMLParser.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/Reflection.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/ReflectionAccessor.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/ReflectionMember.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/ReflectionMethod.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/ReflectionMethodParameter.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src/fquery/reflect/ReflectionVariable.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/AllTests.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/FQueryTest.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/fquery","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/fquery/collection","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/fquery/collection/DisplayListIteratorTest.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/fquery/collection/DisplayObjectIteratorTest.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/fquery/laml","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/fquery/laml/LAMLParserTest.as","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test/fquery/reflect","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/fquery/reflect/ReflectionTest.as","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Luke

If no code or format are supplied, future\n    calls to \"as_string\" and \"convert\" will use the default format and code\n    values.\n\n    You can set the defaults by calling the code/format values as class\n    methods:\n\n        Data::Currency->code('USD');\n        Data::Currency->format('FMT_COMMON');\n\n        my $currency = Data::Currency->new(1.23);\n        print $currency->as_string; # $1.23\n\n        my $currency = Data::Currency->new(1.23, 'CAD', 'FMT_STANDARD');\n        print $currency->as_string; # 1.23 CAD\n\n    The following defaults are set when Data::Currency is loaded:\n\n        value:  0\n        code:   USD\n        format: FMT_COMMON\n\nMETHODS\n  code\n    Arguments: $code\n\n    Gets/sets the three letter currency code for the current currency\n    object. \"code\" dies loudly if \"code\" isn't a valid currency code.\n\n  convert\n    Arguments: $code\n\n    Returns a new Data::Currency object containing the converted value.\n\n    If no \"code\" is specified, the current value of \"code\" will be used. If\n    the currency you are converting to is the same as the current objects\n    currency code, convert will just return itself.\n\n    Remember, convert returns another currency object, so you can chain\n    away:\n\n        my $price = Data::Currency->new(1.25, 'USD');\n        print $price->convert('CAD')->as_string;\n\n    \"convert\" dies if \"code\" isn't valid currency code or isn't defined.\n\n  converter_class\n    Arguments: $converter_class\n\n    Gets/sets the converter class to be used when converting currency\n    numbers.\n\n        Data::Currency->converter_class('MyCurrencyConverter');\n\n    The converter class can be any class that supports the following method\n    signature:\n\n        sub convert {\n            my ($self, $price, $from, $to) = @_;\n\n            return $converted_price;\n        };\n\n    This method dies if the specified class can not be loaded.\n\n  format\n    Arguments: $options\n\n    Gets/sets the format to be used when \"as_string\" is called.

The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account,\nUpdate Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.\n\nIn Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping\nlayer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.\n\nThe controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both\nlayers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers\nare bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is\nunlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much\nmore separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of\nRails.  You can read more about Action Pack in\nlink:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.\n\n\n== Getting Started\n\n1. At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the <tt>rails</tt> command\n   and your application name. Ex: rails myapp\n2. Change directory into myapp and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)\n3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get \"Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!\"\n4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application\n\n\n== Web Servers\n\nBy default, Rails will try to use Mongrel and lighttpd if they are installed, otherwise\nRails will use WEBrick, the webserver that ships with Ruby. When you run script/server,\nRails will check if Mongrel exists, then lighttpd and finally fall back to WEBrick. This ensures\nthat you can always get up and running quickly.\n\nMongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires compilation) that is\nsuitable for development and deployment of Rails applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed,\ngetting up and running with mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>.\nMore info at: http://mongrel.rubyforge.org\n\nIf Mongrel is not installed, Rails will look for lighttpd. It's considerably faster than\nMongrel and WEBrick and also suited for production use, but requires additional\ninstallation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged\nto start with Mongrel). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from\nhttp://www.lighttpd.net.\n\nAnd finally, if neither Mongrel or lighttpd are installed, Rails will use the built-in Ruby\nweb server, WEBrick. WEBrick is a small Ruby web server suitable for development, but not\nfor production.\n\nBut of course its also possible to run Rails on any platform that supports FCGI.\nApache, LiteSpeed, IIS are just a few. For more information on FCGI,\nplease visit: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI\n\n\n== Apache .htaccess example\n\n# General Apache options\nAddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi\nOptions +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI\n\n# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,\n# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests\n# \n# Example:\n#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*\n#   RewriteRule .* - [L]\n\n# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails\n# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow\n# \n# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one\n#\n# Example:\n#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]\nRewriteEngine On\n\n# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,\n# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.\n#\n# Example:\n#   Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public\n#   RewriteBase /myrailsapp\n\nRewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]\nRewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]\n\n# In case Rails experiences terminal errors\n# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead\n# \n# Example:\n#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html\n\nErrorDocument 500 \"<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed to start properly\"\n\n\n== Debugging Rails\n\nSometimes your application goes wrong.  Fortunately there are a lot of tools that\nwill help you debug it and get it back on the rails.\n\nFirst area to check is the application log files.  Have \"tail -f\" commands running\non the server.log and development.log. Rails will automatically display debugging\nand runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the\nbrowser on requests from 127.0.0.1.\n\nYou can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your code using\nthe Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def destroy\n      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])\n      @weblog.destroy\n      logger.info(\"#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!\")\n    end\n  end\n\nThe result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:\n\n  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1\n\nMore information on how to use the logger is at http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/\n\nAlso, Ruby documentation can be found at http://www.ruby-lang.org/ including:\n\n* The Learning Ruby (Pickaxe) Book: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/\n* Learn to Program: http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/  (a beginners guide)\n\nThese two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language\nand also on programming in general.\n\n\n== Debugger\n\nDebugger support is available through the debugger command when you start your Mongrel or\nWebrick server with --debugger. This means that you can break out of execution at any point\nin the code, investigate and change the model, AND then resume execution! \nYou need to install ruby-debug to run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use 'gem install ruby-debug'\nExample:\n\n  class WeblogController < ActionController::Base\n    def index\n      @posts = Post.find(:all)\n      debugger\n    end\n  end\n\nSo the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you\nwith a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:\n\n  >> @posts.inspect\n  => \"[#<Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>nil, \\\"body\\\"=>nil, \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"1\\\"}>,\n       #<Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\\\"title\\\"=>\\\"Rails you know!\\\", \\\"body\\\"=>\\\"Only ten..\\\", \\\"id\\\"=>\\\"2\\\"}>]\"\n  >> @posts.first.title = \"hello from a debugger\"\n  => \"hello from a debugger\"\n\n...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:\n\n  >> f = @posts.first\n  => #<Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={\"title\"=>nil, \"body\"=>nil, \"id\"=>\"1\"}>\n  >> f.\n  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nFinally, when you're ready to resume execution, you enter \"cont\"\n\n\n== Console\n\nYou can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.\nHere you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the\napplication is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the\ndatabase. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.\nPassing an argument will specify a different environment, like <tt>script/console production</tt>.\n\nTo reload your controllers and models after launching the console run <tt>reload!</tt>\n\n== dbconsole\n\nYou can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.\nYou would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.\nStarting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an\nargument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.\nCurrently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.\n\n== Description of Contents\n\napp\n  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.\n\napp/controllers\n  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for\n  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController\n  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.\n\napp/models\n  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.\n  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.\n\napp/views\n  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like\n  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use eRuby\n  syntax.\n\napp/views/layouts\n  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common\n  header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout using the\n  <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb. Inside default.html.erb,\n  call <% yield %> to render the view using this layout.\n\napp/helpers\n  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are generated\n  for you automatically when using script/generate for controllers. Helpers can be used to\n  wrap functionality for your views into methods.\n\nconfig\n  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.\n\ndb\n  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all\n  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.\n\ndoc\n  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when generated\n  using <tt>rake doc:app</tt>\n\nlib\n  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't\n  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.\n\npublic\n  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,\n  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files. This should be\n  set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server.\n\nscript\n  Helper scripts for automation and generation.\n\ntest\n  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the script/generate scripts, template\n  test files will be generated for you and placed in this directory.\n\nvendor\n  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.\n  If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under vendor/rails/.\n  This directory is in the load path.\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":125277},{"lang":"JavaScript","bytes":90693}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Capfile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers/admin","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/controllers/admin/attendees_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/admin/events_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/admin_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/application_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/events_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/helpers/admin","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/helpers/admin/attendees_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/admin/events_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/admin/users_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/application_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/events_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/sessions_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/helpers/users_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/models/attendee.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/event.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/registration.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/user.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/models/user_mailer.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/admin","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/admin/attendees","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/admin/attendees/index.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events/_form.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events/_preview.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events/edit.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events/index.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/events/new.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/index.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/users","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/admin/users/_form.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/users/edit.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/users/index.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/admin/users/new.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/events/_admin_menu.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/_event_desc.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/done.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/index.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/registration.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/show.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/events/tokyo03.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/layouts","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/layouts/admin.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/layouts/application.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/registration","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/registration/message.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/sessions","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/sessions/_new.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/sessions/new.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/shared","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/shared/_flash.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/shared/error.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user_mailer","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/user_mailer/activation.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/user_mailer/signup_notification.erb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"app/views/users","type":"Tree"},{"path":"app/views/users/_user_bar.html.haml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs","type":"Tree"},{"path":"bugs/issue-07d7c1652d2716c6eb6273fe37c5982cc7d9eebc.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-19455b297c284e0dce7afbb3bc5841925e2ed0a3.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-23e78353cf0ce7755b67a7a353353dc94ee0b710.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-3289a240dce3ed7d1107f781833c1eab5978a9ce.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-766a9a093173fd58515787f4f691dd0ffb423a36.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-7abfd3cad286512addaacd07352a8eb747f007ca.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-92c62813a4ad7aba0ac1b342753af6b3db90d258.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-9841a8e4cf2ed0178bcc5f8541785244ec99678b.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-aec53f1194e0a1bad4bfdd6b824fe983259d6970.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-b1073ed0470c3b24b0531a6cc419fd5fdcd1691a.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/issue-ebb33e82ebc4b35be5103efb6d214f9e24d69ec1.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"bugs/project.yaml","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config","type":"Tree"},{"path":"config/boot.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/config_action_controller_session.rb.sample","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config/database.yml","type":"Blob"}

plugin provides a taglib for displaying avatars. At the moment we only support gravatars (globally-recognized avatars).","readme":"Note:\n\nThe official documentation is locate at: http://www.grails.org/Avatar+Plugin\n\nThis plugin provides a taglib for displaying avatars. At the moment we only support gravatars (globally-recognized avatars).\n\nGravatars allow users to configure an avatar to go with their email address at a central location: gravatar.com. Gravatar-aware websites can then look up and display each userâ€˜s preferred avatar, without having to handle avatar management. The user gets the benefit of not having to set up an avatar for each site that they post on.\n\n\n==Code==\nPlugin code is located at GitHub http://github.com/domix/avatarplugin/tree/master\n\n\n==Installation==\n'grails install-plugin avatar'\n\n\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe plugin usage is quite simple.\n\n'For Gravatar image'\n\nExample: <avatar:gravatar email=\"${user.email}\"/>\n\nThe tagLib will generate the following HTML code: \n<img alt=\"Gravatar\" class=\"avatar\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f2f68f9b5281cd7c2eb7eecba1\" width=\"20\" />\n\nAs you can see, the taglib will generate some html default attributes like:\n\n * id & name\n * heigth & width\n * CSS class\n * alt\n\n\nYou can customize this default values as follows: \n<avatar:gravatar email=\"${user.email}\" alt=\"My Avatar\" cssClass=\"myCss\" size=\"50\"/>\n\nOutput:\n<img alt=\"My Avatar\" class=\"myCss\" height=\"50\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f2f68f9b2814cd7c2eb7eecb9c\" width=\"50\" />\n\n\nAlternatively you can customize default avatar to users who don't have a Gravatar Account:\n<avatar:gravatar email=\"${user.email}\" defaultGravatarUrl=\"${'http://mydomain.com/images/default-gravatar-80.png'.encodeAsURL()}\" />\n\nAlso can be set the Gravatar rating:\n<avatar:gravatar email=\"${user.email}\" gravatarRating=\"G\" />\n\n'For twitter image'\n\nExample: <avatar:twitter user=\"${user.twitter}\"/>\n\nOutput:\n<img alt='twitter' class='avatar' height='50' width='50' src='http://a0.twimg.com/profile_images/1124040897/at-twitter_normal.png' title='twitter'/>\n\nYou can customize:\n * heigth & width\n * CSS class\n * alt\n\n'For facebook image'\n\nExample: <avatar:facebook user=\"${user.facebookId}\"/>\n\nOutput:\n<img alt='facebook' class='avatar' height='50' width='50' src='https://graph.facebook.com/facebook/picture' title='facebook'/>\n\nYou can customize:\n * heigth & width\n * CSS class\n * alt\n\n==Configuration==\n\nTo avoid expensive configuration each time plugin usage, you can configure global settings as follows:\n\nIn Config.groovy for Gravatar service\n\navatarPlugin {\n\tdefaultGravatarUrl=\"\"\"http://yourdomain.com/images/default-gravatar-80.png\"\"\"\n\tgravatarRating=\"G\"\n}\n\nTo use twitter and/or facebook avatars you don't need configuration","language":[{"lang":"Groovy","bytes":10573},{"lang":"Java","bytes":1513}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"AvatarGrailsPlugin.groovy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"History.md","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"application.properties","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/conf","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app/conf/UrlMappings.groovy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com/synergyj","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com/synergyj/grails","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com/synergyj/grails/plugins","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/controllers/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar/AvatarController.groovy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app/i18n","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/i18n/messages.properties","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com/synergyj","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com/synergyj/grails","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com/synergyj/grails/plugins","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/taglib/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar/AvatarTagLib.groovy","type":"Blob"},{"path":"grails-app/views","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/views/avatar","type":"Tree"},{"path":"grails-app/views/avatar/index.gsp","type":"Blob"},{"path":"src","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj/grails","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj/grails/plugins","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar/util","type":"Tree"},{"path":"src/java/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar/util/MD5Util.java","type":"Blob"},{"path":"test","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com/synergyj","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com/synergyj/grails","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com/synergyj/grails/plugins","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar","type":"Tree"},{"path":"test/unit/com/synergyj/grails/plugins/avatar/AvatarTagLibSpec.groovy","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Domingo

I'm starting with some much needed keyboard navigation. It is currently built using jQuery and is still pretty ghetto. The injection of jQuery uses some stuff that only works on Greasemonkey & Firefox, although I will work to figure out how to make it work in Fluid for some killer SSB action.\n\nMake sure you update the @include with your OWA address\n\n### WHAT IT DOES\nTo start it adds some keyboard navigation, a la Gmail.\n\n#### Main tab navigation:\n\n* 1 - goes to mail inbox\n* 2 - goes to calendar\n* 3 - goes to contacts\n\n#### On-page navigation:\n\n* f - focus the search box\n* j - goes down one record of a table\n* k - goes up one record of a table\n* l - goes to the next page\n* h - goes to the previous page\n* x - selects a record's checkbox\n* d - clicks the Delete button\n* n - clicks the New button\n* u - clicks the Junk buttonâ€ \n* r - clicks the Reply buttonâ€ \n* a - clicks the Reply to All buttonâ€ \n* w - clicks the Forward buttonâ€ \n* esc - clicks the Close button\n* enter - opens the currently highlighted record\n\nâ€  Mail tab specific\n\n#### To Do\n\n* Make it work on Fluid\n* Embed jQuery in the script instead of linking to jquery.com\n* Autocheck for mail every few minutes\n* Notification of new messages\n* Make shortcuts more robust, such as reusing letters for different things when in different sections\n* Overlay with the shortcuts for quick reference\n* More functionality coverage in the shortcuts\n* A new

If you need help with something, please use google groups. I check both regularly and get emails when anything happens, so that is the best place to get help. This also benefits other people in the future with the same questions / problems. Thank you.\n\n== Install & use\n\nInstall the gem from rubyforge:\n\n  sudo gem install searchlogic\n\nNow just set it as a dependency in your project and you are ready to go.\n\nYou can also install this as a plugin:\n\n  script/plugin install git://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic.git\n\nSee below for usage examples.\n\n== Search using conditions on columns\n\nInstead of explaining what Searchlogic can do, let me show you. Let's start at the top:\n\n  # We have the following model\n  User(id: integer, created_at: datetime, username: string, age: integer)\n  \n  # Searchlogic gives you a bunch of named scopes for free:\n  User.username_equals(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_equals([\"bjohnson\", \"thunt\"])\n  User.username_equals(\"a\"..\"b\")\n  User.username_does_not_equal(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_begins_with(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_not_begin_with(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_like(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_not_like(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_ends_with(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.username_not_end_with(\"bjohnson\")\n  User.age_greater_than(20)\n  User.age_greater_than_or_equal_to(20)\n  User.age_less_than(20)\n  User.age_less_than_or_equal_to(20)\n  User.username_null\n  User.username_not_null\n  User.username_blank\n\nAny named scope Searchlogic creates is dynamic and created via method_missing. Meaning it will only create what you need. Also, keep in mind, these are just named scopes, you can chain them, call methods off of them, etc:\n\n  scope = User.username_like(\"bjohnson\").age_greater_than(20).id_less_than(55)\n  scope.all\n  scope.first\n  scope.count\n  # etc...\n\nFor a complete list of conditions please see the constants in Searchlogic::NamedScopes::Conditions.\n\n== Use condition aliases\n\nTyping out 'greater_than_or_equal_to' is not fun. Instead Searchlogic provides various aliases for the conditions. For a complete list please see Searchlogic::NamedScopes::Conditions. But they are pretty straightforward:\n\n  User.username_is(10)  # equals\n  User.username_eq(10)  # equals\n  User.id_lt(10)        # less than\n  User.id_lte(10)       # less than or equal to\n  User.id_gt(10)        # greater than\n  User.id_gte(10)       # greater than or equal to\n  # etc...\n\n== Search using scopes in associated classes\n\nThis is my favorite part of Searchlogic. You can dynamically call scopes on associated classes and Searchlogic will take care of creating the necessary joins for you. This is REALY nice for keeping your code DRY. The best way to explain this is to show you:\n\n=== Searchlogic provided scopes\n\nLet's take some basic scopes that Searchlogic provides for every model:\n\n  # We have the following relationships\n  User.has_many :orders\n  Order.has_many :line_items\n  LineItem\n  \n  # Set conditions on association columns\n  User.orders_total_greater_than(20)\n  User.orders_line_items_price_greater_than(20)\n  \n  # Order by association columns\n  User.ascend_by_order_total\n  User.descend_by_orders_line_items_price\n\nThis is recursive, you can travel through your associations simply by typing it in the name of the method. Again these are just named scopes. You can chain them together, call methods off of them, etc.\n\n=== Custom associated scopes\n\nAlso, these conditions aren't limited to the scopes Searchlogic provides. You can use your own scopes. Like this:\n\n  LineItem.named_scope :expensive, :conditions => \"line_items.price > 500\"\n  \n  User.orders_line_items_expensive\n\nAs I stated above, Searchlogic will take care of creating the necessary joins for you. This is REALLY nice when trying to keep your code DRY, because if you wanted to use a scope like this in your User model you would have to copy over the conditions. Now you have 2 named scopes that are essentially doing the same thing. Why do that when you can dynamically access that scope using this feature?\n\n=== Polymorphic associations\n\nPolymorphic associations are tough because ActiveRecord doesn't support them with the :joins or :include options. Searchlogic checks for a specific syntax and takes care of this for you. Ex:\n\n  Audit.belongs_to :auditable, :polymorphic => true\n  User.has_many :audits, :as => :auditable\n  \n  Audit.auditable_user_type_username_equals(\"ben\")\n\nThe above will take care of creating the inner join on the polymorphic association so that it only looks for type 'User'. On the surface it works the same as a non polymorphic association. The syntax difference being that you need to call the association and then specify the type:\n  \n  [polymorphic association name]_[association type]_type\n\n=== Uses :joins not :include\n\nAnother thing to note is that the joins created by Searchlogic do NOT use the :include option, making them <em>much</em> faster. Instead they leverage the :joins option, which is great for performance. To prove my point here is a quick benchmark from an application I am working on:\n\n  Benchmark.bm do |x|\n    x.report { 10.times { Event.tickets_id_gt(10).all(:include => :tickets) } }\n    x.report { 10.times { Event.tickets_id_gt(10).all } }\n  end\n        user     system      total        real\n   10.120000   0.170000  10.290000 ( 12.625521)\n    2.630000   0.050000   2.680000 (  3.313754)\n\nIf you want to use the :include option, just specify it:\n\n  User.orders_line_items_price_greater_than(20).all(:include => {:orders => :line_items})\n\nObviously, only do this if you want to actually use the included objects. Including objects into a query can be helpful with performance, especially when solving an N+1 query problem.\n\n== Order your search\n\nJust like the various conditions, Searchlogic gives you some very basic scopes for ordering your data:\n\n  User.ascend_by_id\n  User.descend_by_id\n  User.ascend_by_orders_line_items_price\n  # etc...\n\n== Use any or all\n\nEvery condition you've seen in this readme also has 2 related conditions that you can use. Example:\n\n  User.username_like_any(\"bjohnson\", \"thunt\")   # will return any users that have either of the strings in their username\n  User.username_like_all(\"bjohnson\", \"thunt\")   # will return any users that have all of the strings in their username\n  User.username_like_any([\"bjohnson\", \"thunt\"]) # also accepts an array\n\nThis is great for checkbox filters, etc. Where you can pass an array right from your form to this condition.\n\n== Combine scopes with 'OR'\n\nIn the same fashion that Searchlogic provides a tool for accessing scopes in associated classes, it also provides a tool for combining scopes with 'OR'. As we all know, when scopes are combined they are joined with 'AND', but sometimes you need to combine scopes with 'OR'. Searchlogic solves this problem:\n\n  User.username_or_first_name_like(\"ben\")\n  => \"username LIKE '%ben%' OR first_name like'%ben%'\"\n  \n  User.id_or_age_lt_or_username_or_first_name_begins_with(10)\n  => \"id < 10 OR age < 10 OR username LIKE 'ben%' OR first_name like'ben%'\"\n\nNotice you don't have to specify the explicit condition (like, gt, lt, begins with, etc.). You just need to eventually specify it. If you specify a column it will just use the next condition specified. So instead of:\n\n  User.username_like_or_first_name_like(\"ben\")\n\nYou can do:\n\n  User.username_or_first_name_like(\"ben\")\n\nAgain, these just map to named scopes. Use Searchlogic's dynamic scopes, use scopes on associations, use your own custom scopes. As long as it maps to a named scope it will join the conditions with 'OR'. There are no limitations.\n\n== Create scope procedures\n\nSometimes you notice a pattern in your application where you are constantly combining certain named scopes. You want to keep the flexibility of being able to mix and match small named scopes, while at the same time being able to call a single scope for a common task. User searchlogic's scpe procedure:\n\n  User.scope_procedure :awesome, lambda { first_name_begins_with(\"ben\").last_name_begins_with(\"johnson\").website_equals(\"binarylogic.com\") }\n\nAll that this is doing is creating a class level method, but what is nice about this method is that is more inline with your other named scopes. It also tells searchlogic that this method is 'safe' to use when using the search method. Ex:\n\n  User.search(:awesome => true)\n\nOtherwise searchlogic will ignore the 'awesome' condition because there is no way to tell that its a valid scope. This is a security measure to keep users from passing in a scope with a named like 'destroy_all'.\n\n== Make searching and ordering data in your application trivial\n\nThe above is great, but what about tying all of this in with a search form in your application? What would be really nice is if we could use an object that represented a single search. Like this...\n\n  search = User.search(:username_like => \"bjohnson\", :age_less_than => 20)\n  search.all\n\nThe above is equivalent to:\n\n  User.username_like(\"bjohnson\").age_less_than(20).all\n\nYou can set, read, and chain conditions off of your search too:\n\n  search.username_like                              => \"bjohnson\"\n  search.age_gt = 2                                 => 2\n  search.id_gt(10).email_begins_with(\"bjohnson\")    => <#Searchlogic::Search...>\n  search.all                                        => An array of users\n  search.count                                      => integer\n  # .. etc\n\nSo let's start with the controller...\n\n=== Your controller\n\nThe search class just chains named scopes together for you. What's so great about that? It keeps your controllers extremely simple:\n\n  class UsersController < ApplicationController\n    def index\n      @search = User.search(params[:search])\n      @users = @search.all\n    end\n  end\n\nIt doesn't get any simpler than that.\n\n=== Your form\n\nAdding a search condition is as simple as adding a condition to your form. Remember all of those named scopes above? Just create fields with the same names:\n\n  - form_for @search do |f|\n    = f.text_field :username_like\n    = f.select :age_greater_than, (0..100)\n    = f.text_field :orders_total_greater_than\n    = f.submit\n\nWhen a Searchlogic::Search object is passed to form_for it will add a hidden field for the \"order\" condition, to preserve the order of the data.\n\n=== Additional helpers\n\nThere really isn't a big need for helpers in searchlogic, other than helping you order data. If you want to order your search with a link, just specify the name of the column. Ex:\n\n  = order @search, :by => :age\n  = order @search, :by => :created_at, :as => \"Created date\"\n\nThe first one will create a link that alternates between calling \"ascend_by_age\" and \"descend_by_age\". If you wanted to order your data by more than just a column, create your own named scopes: \"ascend_by_*\" and \"descend_by_*\". The \"order\" helper is a very straight forward helper, checkout the docs for some of the options.\n\n<b>This helper is just a convenience method. It's extremely simple and there is nothing wrong with creating your own. If it doesn't do what you want, copy the code, modify it, and create your own. You could even fork the project, modify it there, and use your own gem.</b>\n\n== Use your existing named scopes\n\nThis is one of the big differences between Searchlogic v1 and v2. What about your existing named scopes? Let's say you have this:\n\n  User.named_scope :four_year_olds, :conditions => {:age => 4}\n\nAgain, these are all just named scopes, use it in the same way:\n\n  User.search(:four_year_olds => true, :username_like => \"bjohnson\")\n\nNotice we pass true as the value. If a named scope does not accept any parameters (arity == 0) you can simply pass it true or false. If you pass false, the named scope will be ignored. If your named scope accepts a parameter, the value will be passed right to the named scope regardless of the value.\n\nNow just throw it in your form:\n\n  - form_for @search do |f|\n    = f.text_field :username_like\n    = f.check_box :four_year_olds\n    = f.submit\n\nThis really allows Searchlogic to extend beyond what it provides internally. If Searchlogic doesn't provide a named scope for that crazy edge case that you need, just create your own named scope and use it. The sky is the limit.\n\n== Pagination (leverage will_paginate)\n\nInstead of recreating the wheel with pagination, Searchlogic works great with will_paginate. All that Searchlogic is doing is creating named scopes, and will_paginate works great with named scopes:\n\n  User.username_like(\"bjohnson\").age_less_than(20).paginate(:page => params[:page])\n  User.search(:username_like => \"bjohnson\", :age_less_than => 20).paginate(:page => params[:page])\n\nIf you don't like will_paginate, use another solution, or roll your own. Pagination really has nothing to do with searching, and the main goal for Searchlogic v2 was to keep it lean and simple. No reason to recreate the wheel and bloat the library.\n\n== Conflicts with other gems\n\nYou will notice searchlogic wants to create a method called \"search\". So do other libraries like thinking-sphinx, etc. So searchlogic has a no conflict resolution. If the \"search\" method is already taken the method will be called \"searchlogic\" instead. So instead of\n\n  User.search\n\nYou would do:\n\n  User.searchlogic\n\n== Under the hood\n\nBefore I use a library in my application I like to glance at the source and try to at least understand the basics of how it works. If you are like me, a nice little explanation from the author is always helpful:\n\nSearchlogic utilizes method_missing to create all of these named scopes. When it hits method_missing it creates a named scope to ensure it will never hit method missing for that named scope again. Sort of a caching mechanism. It works in the same fashion as ActiveRecord's \"find_by_*\" methods. This way only the named scopes you need are created and nothing more.\n\nThe search object is just a proxy to your model that only delegates calls that map to named scopes and nothing more. This is obviously done for security reasons. It also helps make form integration easier, by type casting values, and playing nice with form_for. This class is pretty simple as well.\n\nThat's about it, the named scope options are pretty bare bones and created just like you would manually.\n\n== Credit\n\nThanks a lot to {Tyler Hunt}[http://github.com/tylerhunt] for helping plan, design, and start the project.

So, instead of looking up the AR class by name, now a reference to the class is passed in."},"author_login":"johndouthat","committer_login":"johndouthat"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"John F.

This is because it is not specified in the [gemspec](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/20#license) of your last release.\n\n  via e.g.\n\n```\n  spec.license = 'MIT'\n  # or\n  spec.licenses = ['MIT', 'GPL-2']\n```\n\n  Including a license in your gemspec is an easy way for rubygems.org and other tools to check how your gem is licensed.  As you can imagine, scanning your repository for a LICENSE file or parsing the README, and then attempting to identify the license or licenses is much more difficult and more error prone. So, even for projects that already specify a license, including a license in your gemspec is a good practice. See, for example, how [rubygems.org uses the gemspec to  display the rails gem license](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails).\n\n  There is even a [License Finder gem](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) to help companies/individuals ensure all gems they use meet their licensing needs. This tool depends on license information being available in the gemspec.  This is an important enough issue that _even Bundler now generates gems with a default 'MIT' license_.\n\n  I hope you'll consider specifying a license in your gemspec. If not, please just close the issue with a nice message. In either case, I'll follow up. Thanks for your time!\n\n  Appendix:\n\n  If you need help choosing a [license](http://opensource.org/licenses) (sorry, I haven't checked your readme or looked for a license file), GitHub has created a [license picker tool](http://choosealicense.com/).  Code without a license specified defaults to 'All rights reserved'-- denying others all rights to use of the code.\n  Here's a [list of the license names I've found and their frequencies](https://github.com/bf4/gemproject/blob/master/license_usage.csv)\n\n  p.s. In case you're wondering how I found you and why I made this issue, it's because I'm collecting stats on gems (I was originally looking for download data) and decided to collect license metadata,too, and [make issues for gemspecs not specifying a license as a public service :)](https://github.com/bf4/gemproject/issues/1).

Also to my roommate for \ndebugging (desnaking?) the app with me and making me realize that I'm a dumb\nprogrammer.\n\n## I hate snakes! Why does it always have to be snakes!?\n\nFirst of all, download Shoes at:\n\nhttp://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds\n\nTo get it running, point your shoes binary at app.rb. This is currently tested\non Ubuntu, and I'll get around to testing it on XP and OSX soon.\n\n## I'm sick of these \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* snakes on this \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* plane!\n\nMy personal high score is 76.

This step is optional.  The intention is to keep SASS files, which are really program files, separate from your custom CSS.  Additionally this will put your generated CSS files in the compiled dir, which will ensure they don't overwrite anything you have existing or create in the future.\n\n  Merb::Config.use do |c|\n    ...\n    # Added to support the compass SASS CSS framework\n    c[:compass] = {\n      :stylesheets => 'app/stylesheets',\n      :compiled_stylesheets => 'public/stylesheets/compiled'\n    }\n    ...\n  end\n\nAdd the necessary dependencies to config/init.rb\n\n  ...\n  dependencies \"merb-haml\", \"compass\"\n\n  Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do\n  end\n  ...\n\nCreate a new SASS stylesheets dir (if you chose to follow the relevant config step above):\n\n  MERB_ROOT/app/stylesheets\n\nAdd a SASS file to this dir.  You may want to copy the master.sass out of this sample app.  This file recreates the master.css file which ships in a default Merb app but uses SASS and BluePrint instead of raw CSS.  You can change or extend this as you please.

For example:\n   \n  require 'rubygems'\n  require 'raspell'\n  \n  speller = Aspell.new(\"en_US\")\n  speller.suggestion_mode = Aspell::NORMAL\n  \n  string = \"my haert wil go on\"\n  \n  string.gsub(/[\\w\\']+/) do |word| \n    if !speller.check(word) \n      # word is wrong\n      puts \"Possible correction for #{word}:\"\n      puts speller.suggest(word).first\n    end\n  end\n\nThis outputs:\n\n  Possible correction for haert:\n  heart\n  Possible correction for wil:\n  Will\n\nNote that <tt>suggest</tt> returns an array of suggestions even for words that are correctly spelled.\n\n== Options\n\nThe most useful options are <tt>suggestion_mode</tt>, and the passthrough option <tt>ignore_case</tt>. Passthrough options have to be set as so:\n\n  speller.set_option(\"ignore-case\", \"true\")\n\nSee http://aspell.net/man-html/The-Options.html for a list of the passthrough options. \n\n== Reporting problems\n\nThe support forum is here[http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=13988].\n\nPatches and contributions are very welcome.

strip dross from web pages I'm interested in","readme":"WebStrip\n========\n\nA simple web app to filter unwanted crap out of web-pages.\n\nThe idea is to take a url, go there and pull the page's html text.\nFor pages that are the first of a series I pull the link block.\nFor pages with a \"next\" I follow the chain.\nThen for each page I pull the divs I actually want, remove extraneous\nfluff - banners, scripts - and serve them up in some crude css.\n\nPrintWhatYouLike.com does the same in a more interactive way.\n\nI got this running in a single page app for about a dozen sites\nusing \"camping webstrip.rb\" and localhost:3301. But now after a brief\nflirtation with Sinatra I'm basing directly on Rack as that seems much\nless hassle to run on Dreamhost using Passenger. I'm trying to avoid all the\ndependencies that I can, but you must have the Hpricot and open-uri gems\nand of course, Rack running on Passenger (which DH provides).\n\nTo install just checkout the whole tree and point a domain at webstrip/public.\n\nA little better css in style_block() would be nice.\n\nThe setup is modular, so once you've cloned the repo you can add sites\nby just dropping their def files into the \"sites\" directory. The page router\nloads a ruby file named \"#{URI(url).hostname}.rb\" replacing '.'s with '_'s,\ninstantiates a new object of the same class name passing the url to it, and\nthen sends this object a request for filtered page content. Each def file\ndefines a sub-class of WebStrip (or LinkedPageSeries or ChainedPageSeries)\nand overrides clean_page(doc) which returns a text string of html given the\nHpricot document parsed from the url.\n\nClass Hierarchy\n---------------\n    PageRouter - implements basic response to rack call(), routes page\n    WebStrip - class with generic routines, must override clean_page\n      |-- LinkedPageSeries - handles articles with a link block\n      | '-- www_..._com - your sub-classes here\n      |-- ChainedPageSeries - handles articles with a \"next\" link\n      | '-- www_..._com - your sub-classes here\n      '-- www_..._com - your sub-classes here\n\nFile Layout\n-----------\n    webstrip\n      |-- README.markdown\n      |-- config.ru\n      |-- page_router.rb\n      |-- public\n      |   |-- favicon.gif\n      |   `-- favicon.ico\n      |-- sites\n      |   `-- www_..._com.rb\n      |-- tmp\n      |   `-- restart.txt\n      `-- webstrip.rb\n\n\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":22116}],"repository":[{"path":"README.markdown","type":"Blob"},{"path":"TODO.markdown","type":"Blob"},{"path":"config.ru","type":"Blob"},{"path":"page_router.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public","type":"Tree"},{"path":"public/.htaccess","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/favicon.gif","type":"Blob"},{"path":"public/favicon.ico","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites","type":"Tree"},{"path":"sites/arstechnica_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/blogs_ft_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/krugman_blogs_nytimes_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/news_cnet_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/nymag_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/reviews_cnet_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/sample_site_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/www_atimes_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/www_boston_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/www_economist_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/www_investorsinsight_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"sites/www_technologyreview_com.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"tmp","type":"Tree"},{"path":"tmp/restart.txt","type":"Blob"},{"path":"web_strip.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"PeeDee","email":"net.prophet.nz@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"PeeDee","email":"net.prophet.nz@gmail.com"},"message":"Economist and Krugman now live on development."},"author_login":"PeeDee","committer_login":"PeeDee"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"PeeDee","email":"net.prophet.nz@gmail.com"},"commiter":{"name":"PeeDee","email":"net.prophet.nz@gmail.com"},"message":"Changes to use Netbeans IDE for debugging.

Keep reading if you're unsure how this affects you.\n\ngist.el -- Emacs integration for gist.github.com\n================================================\n\nUses your local GitHub config if it can find it.\n\nGo to your [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a personal access token with `gist` scope\n\nNext run:\n\n``` Shell\ngit config --global github.user <your-github-user-name>\ngit config --global github.oauth-token <your-personal-access-token-with-gist-scope>\n```\n\nNews\n====\n\nWhat's new in 1.0 ?\n\n* gist.el now maintains a local cache so as to not go to the gist server every now and then.\n* multi-files gist support (indicated by a '+' in the gist list)\n* improved gist-list buffer, based on tabulated-list.el (same codebase as package.el)\n    New keybindings:\n    * `g` : reload the gist list from server\n    * `e` : edit current gist description\n    * `k` : delete current gist\n    * `+` : add a file to the current gist\n    * `-` : remove a file from the current gist\n    * `y` : print current gist url\n    * `b` : browse current gist\n    * `*` : star gist\n    * `^` : unstar gist\n    * `f` : fork gist\n* in-place edition. While viewing a gist file buffer, you can:\n    * `C-x C-s` : save a new version of the gist\n    * `C-x C-w` : rename some file\n* dired integration. From a dired buffer, you can:\n    * `@` : make a gist out of marked files (with a prefix, make it private)\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\ngist.el depends on a number of other modules, that you'll need to install, either manually or by way of Emacs package manager\n\n* tabulated-list.el\n  built-in for emacs 24. If you're using emacs 23, you can find a backport here: https://github.com/sigma/tabulated-list.el\n* gh.el\n  GitHub client library. Install from there: https://github.com/sigma/gh.el\n* pcache.el\n  Really a gh.el dependency. Install from there: https://github.com/sigma/pcache\n* logito.el\n  Really a gh.el dependency. Install from there: https://github.com/sigma/logito\n\nInstall gist.el from marmalade (recommended)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn that scenario, you don't have to deal with the above dependencies yourself.\n\nFor emacs 24, first make sure http://marmalade-repo.org/ is properly configured. Then\n\n    M-x package-install RET gist RET\n\nFor emacs 23, you'll need to install a version of package.el first. Some bootstrap code is available there: https://gist.github.com/1884169\nThen proceed as for emacs 24. You might get some compilation errors, but the package should be operational in the end.\n\nInstall gist.el from git\n------------------------\n\nAfter installing the required dependencies, proceed with:\n\n    $ cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor\n    $ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/gist.el.git\n\nIn your emacs config:\n\n    (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/vendor/gist.el\")\n    (require 'gist)\n\nGetting started\n===============\n\nWhen you first run a gist.el operation, you might be asked for your GitHub username and password. The username will be stored for future use, and a OAuth token will be stored in place of your password.\n\nTo make gist.el forget about those information, just remove them from your ~/.gitconfig file\n\nFunctions\n=========\n\n    gist-list - Lists your gists in a new buffer. Use arrow keys\n    to browse, RET to open one in the other buffer.\n\n    gist-region - Copies Gist URL into the kill ring.\n    With a prefix argument, makes a private gist.\n\n    gist-region-private - Explicitly create a private gist.\n\n    gist-buffer - Copies Gist URL into the kill ring.\n    With a prefix argument, makes a private gist.\n\n    gist-buffer-private - Explicitly create a private gist.\n\n    gist-region-or-buffer - Post either the current region, or if mark\n    is not set, the current buffer as a new paste at gist.github.com .\n    Copies the URL into the kill ring.\n    With a prefix argument, makes a private paste.\n\n    gist-region-or-buffer-private - Explicitly create a gist from the\n    region or buffer.\n\nConfig\n======\n\nSet `gist-view-gist` to non-nil if you want to view your Gist using\n`browse-url` after it is created.\n\nMeta\n====\n\n* Code: `git clone git://github.com/defunkt/gist.el.git`\n* Home:

Install\n\n* Download and unzip Bort\n* Edit the database.yml and the settings.yml files\n* Changed the default password in the bort migration\n* Edit the REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY in each of the environment files\n* Rake db:migrate\n* Have a brew and celebrate\n\nh2. Plugins Installed\n\nBort comes with a few commonly used plugins installed and already setup.\n\nh3. RESTful Authentication\n\nRESTful Authentication is already setup. The routes are setup, along with the mailers and observers.\nForgotten password comes setup, so you don't have to mess around setting it up with every project.\n\nThe AASM plugin comes pre-installed. RESTful Authentication is also setup to use user activation.\n\nh3. User Roles\n\nBort now comes with \"Role Requirement\":http://code.google.com/p/rolerequirement/ by Tim Harper. A default \nadmin role is predefined along with a default admin user. See the migrations for the admin login details.\n\nh3. Open ID Authentication\n\nBort, as of 0.3, has Open ID integrated with RESTful Authentication. Rejoice!\n\nh3. Will Paginate\n\nWe use will_paginate in pretty much every project we use, so Bort comes with it pre-installed.\n\nh3. Rspec & Rspec-rails\n\nYou should be testing your code, so Bort comes with Rspec and Rspec-rails already installed so you're\nready to roll.\n\nh3. Exception Notifier\n\nYou don't want your applications to crash and burn so Exception Notifier is already installed to let \nyou know when everything goes to shit.\n\nh3. Asset Packager\n\nPackages up your css/javascript so you're not sending 143 files down to the user at the same time. Reduces\nload times and saves you bandwidth.\n\nh2. Routes\n\nThe routes for RESful Auth and the forgot password stuff are already sorted for you.\n\nh2. Settings YAML\n\nThere is a settings.yml file that contains site-wide stuff. The site name, url and admin email are all used\nin the RESTful Auth mailers, so you don't need to worry about editing them.\n\nh2. Database YAML\n\nThe database.yml defaults to sqlite3 but also contains the settings for MySQL in comments so you can switch\nover easily.\n\nh2. Capistrano Recipe\n\nBort comes ready to rock capistrano. The recipe that is setup is based on using git and passenger. It's ready\nto go with multistage deployments. It deploys to the production config by default, so if you don't need it\nyou can ignore it. Just update config/deploy/production.rb with your deployment settings.\n\nMore info on capistrano-ext/multistage deployments can be found here: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/7/23/capistrano-multistage\n\nh2. Uses the Database for Sessions\n\nBort is setup to use the database to store sessions by default. \n\nh2. Misc \n\n* password and password_confirmation are set up to be filtered\n* there is a default application layout file\n* a page title helper has been added\n* index.html is already deleted\n* rails.png is already deleted\n* a few changes have been made to the default views\n* a default css file with blank selectors for common rails elements\n\nh2.

Rails plugin which handles image fields of models","readme":"ActsAsImageHolder\n=================\n\nThis plugin handles the work with image-fields, such as validation,\nresizing, watermarking, files organizations etc.\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\nA simple example might be like that. A user unit which has a field\n'avatar' which will contain a file-name of his avatar and all the\navatars will be saved in the \"#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/images/userpics\"\ndirectory.\n\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :image_field => 'avatar',\n                       :output_directory => 'userpics'\nend\n\n\nMore complex example, this time there are two blob-fields one 'image'\nwill keep the image source, the second 'thumb', will contain the image\nthumbnail. All the incomming images will be resized to fit the size of\n600x400, the system will check that they are in type of gif, png or\njpeg and then will automatically generate a thumbnail which will fit\nthe size of 200x150 and will be in format of jpeg. \n\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :image_field => 'image',\n                       :resize_to => '600x400',\n                       :allowed_types => [:gif, :png, :jpeg],\n                       :thumb_field => 'thumb',\n                       :thumb_size => '200x150',\n                       :thumb_type => :jpeg\nend\n\nEach time there will be defined methods to direct assignment the\nfiles, like that\n\nUser.new.image_field = File.open('some/your/file.png', 'rb')\nImage.image = File.open('some/file/of/yours.jpg', 'rb')\n\nSure you can put right there the user uploaded images, use mass\nassignment, etc. Everything will be handled automatically.\n\nOptions\n=======\n\nYou can pass to the method the following options.\n\n[*] Output directory options\n   :output_directory - relative to \"#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/images\" or an\n                absolute directory path.\n\t\t       \n   :subdirectories - a string which will be put in the\n              Time.now.strftime method and will generate\n              subdirectories inside the output-directory.\n\n   NOTE: if the output-directory is not specified, it assumes that you\n   want to save your images as blobs inside your database\n\n[*] Image specification options\n   :image_field - the name of the main image field in your record, by\n                  default is 'image'\n\n   :image_type_field - name of the field where you would like to track\n                 each image type. the system will put strings like\n                 'gif', 'png', 'jpeg' into the field when the image\n                 will be assigned\n\t\t \n   :original_field - if specified the original incomming image will be\n                 stored in here\n\n   :convert_to - :png/:gif/:jpeg - if specified all the incomming\n                 images will be converted to the sepcified type\n\n   :resize_to -  a string like '123x123' which meant width and height\n                 if specified all the incomming images will be\n                 proportionally resiezed to fit the given size.\n\n   :jpeg_quality - if you set the config to convert incomming images to\n                 jpegs, you can specify the jpeg-quality with the option\n\n   :allowed_types - list like [:png, :jpeg] if specified all the\n                 incomming images will get validated against the rule\n\n   :required    - boolean marke which shows if the image field should\n                  be treated as a required one during the validation\n\n   :maximum_bytes - integer maximum size of the incomming images\n\n   :watermark - the watermarking options (see below)\n\n\n[*] Thumbnailing options\n   :thumb_field  - the name of the field which will contain the thumb\n                  file name or the thumb-blob. if specified the thumbs\n                  will be generated automatically each time the main\n                  image field assigned\n\n   :thumb_size   - string like '123x123' which meant as width-height,\n                  if specified thumbs will be created to fit the size\n\n   :thumb_type   - :png/:gif/:jpeg - if specified all the thumbs will\n                  be created in the given type\n\n   :thumb_quality - the jpeg-thumbnails quality\n\n   :thumb_watermark - the thumbnail watermarking options (see below)\n\n\n[*] Shortified versions of the options\n   :directory  == :output_directory\n   :subdirs    == :subdirectories\n   \n   :field      == :image_field\n   :type_field == :image_type_field\n   :original   == :original_field\n   :type       == :convert_to\n   :size       == :resize_to\n   :quality    == :jpeg_quality\n   \n\n\n \nSeveral Images Processing\n=========================\n\nIf have several images on your model, you can specify them by passing\na list of image-definitions like that\n\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :image_fields => [\n                         { :image_field => 'main_image', ...},\n                         { :image_field => 'optional_image',..}\n                       ],\n                       :outout_directory => 'uploaded'\nend\n\nor you can use a shortified interface like this\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :images => [\n                         { :field => 'main_image', :type_field => '...'},\n                         { :field => 'optional_image',..}\n                       ],\n                       :outout_directory => 'uploaded'\nend\n\nSure, each image can have several thumbnails if you like. And you can\nuse the short notation as well\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :image_field => 'full_size',\n                       :thumbs => [\n                         { :field => 'small_size',\n                           :size => '100x100',\n                           :type => :jpeg\n                         }, {\n                           :field => 'average_size',\n                           :size  => '200x200'\n                         }\n                       ]\nend\n\n\nWatermarking\n============\n\nWith the plugin you can automatically put watermarks on your incomming\nimages. You can use a simple text or a file which should be\nwatermarked over the image. The definition might look like that\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :field => 'full_version',\n                       :watermark => {\n                          :text => \"That's mine!\",\n                          :font => {\n                            :size => 40,\n                            :family => \"Arial\",\n                            :weight => :bold\n                          },\n                          :color => 'red'\n                       }\nend\n\nYou can watermark the thumbnails as well if you like so.\n\nclass Image < ActiveRecord::Base\n  acts_as_image_holder :field => 'full_version',\n                       :watermark => {...}\n                       :thumb_field => 'thumb',\n                       :thumb_watermark => {...}\n\n# or like that\n  acts_as_image_holder :field => 'full_version',\n                       :watermark => {...}\n                       :thumbs => [\n                         { :field => 'thumb',\n                           :watermark => {...}\n                         }\n                         .....\n                       ]\nend\n\n\nWatermarking Options\n====================\n\n:text - the text string for the watermark\n\n:font - the font definitions for the text watermark\n  :size - the font size in pixels\n  :family - the font family string \"Arial\"/\"Helvetica\"\n  :weight - the font weight name :bold/:bolder/:normal\n  :style  - the font style :italic/oblique\n  :stretch - the space between the chars\n\n:color - the text color, it can be in any standard format #FFF,\n         #FFFFFFF, string color name, rgb(), etc\n\n:stroke - if you want a stroked text, put the color in here\n\n:stroke_width - the stroke width in pixels, 1 pixel by default\n\n:undercolor - the background color for your text if you need\n  \n:text_align - the text align right/left/center\n\n:file - the name of an image-file or a file object which should be\n        placed over your image\n\n:position - where to put your text. There are several options\n            possible, but they are pretty much standard. Use arrays\n            like [:top, :left], [:center, :right], [:bottom, :center],\n            or just :top, :left, :center, etc. Or some compas like\n            directions :south, :southeast, :north, etc.\n\n:offset - offset of your watermark from the image ages in pixels\n\n:rotate - integer degrees, how the watermark should be rotated\n          (clockwise)\n\n:shade - the shade effect options. An array like\n         [bool, int, int]\n\n:shadow - the shadow effect options. An array like\n         [left_offset=4, top_offset=4, blureness=4, opacity=1]\n\n:shadow_color - the shadow effect color if you need so.\n\n\n\nAdditional Methods\n==================\n\nIn addition you will have several more options on your model which\nwill help you to handle images inside of the model if need so\n\nIf you use filestorage for your images, then for each image and\nthumbnail you will have a method named like \"#{field_name}_url\" which\nwill return the url address of the image.\n\nThen you will have the following methods\n\nresize_file(File/String file_pointer, String size,\n            String format, Integer quality)\n\nresize_file(String blob, String size, String format, Integer quality)\n\nwatermark_file(File/String file_pointer, Hash options)\n\nwatermark_blob(String blob, Hash options)\n\n\nThat's it.

Right now, after the job is ran (successfully or unsucessfully, the \njob is deleted from the db).  That could probably be fixed later.  This isn't multiple runner safe\nat the moment, either.

completions, gem, git, irb, rails","readme":"Ryan Bates Dot Files\n\nThese are config files to set up a system the way I like it.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles\n  cd ~/.dotfiles\n  rake install\n  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nI am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with \nminor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash \nfiles as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with \nthe following command.\n\n  chsh -s /bin/zsh\n\n\nFeatures\n\nI normally place all of my coding projects in ~/code, so this directory \ncan easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the \"c\" command.\n\n  c railsca<tab>\n\nThere is also an \"h\" command which behaves similar, but acts on the \nhome path.\n\n  h doc<tab>\n\nTab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:\n\n  rake db:mi<tab>\n  cap de<tab>\n\nTo speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and \n.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in \nmost cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.\n\nThere are a few key bindings set. Many of these require option to be\nset as the meta key. Option-left/right arrow will move cursor by word, \nand control-left/right will move to beginning and end of line. \nControl-option-N will open a new tab with the current directory under\nMac OS X Terminal.\n\nIf you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in\nthe prompt while in a git repository.\n\nIf you're using Rails, you'll find some handy aliases (below). You can \nalso use show_log and hide_log in script/console to show the log inline.\n  \n  ss       # script/server\n  sc       # script/console\n  sg       # script/generate\n  a        # autotest\n  tlog     # tail -f log/development.log\n  rst      # touch tmp/restart.txt\n  migrate  # rake db:migrate db:test:clone\n  scaffold # script/generate nifty_scaffold\n\nSee the other aliases in ~/.zsh/aliases\n\nIf there are some shell configuration settings which you want secure or \nspecific to one system, place it into a ~/.localrc file.

Right now this allows you to do\n\nusers = User.find :all, ...\nusers.load :projects => :milestones\n\nto load a user's projects and the milestones from each project. It takes arguments in the same format as a normal :include\noption (no coincidence - it's calling through to the same code. Some examples can be found at http://www.spacevatican.org/2008/8/8/nested-includes-and-joins)\n\nBetter still:\n\ndoing users[0].projects will guess that you want to access projects for everyone and go ahead and load all those projects\n\nand users[0].projects[0].milestones would load all milestones for all projects for all of the users.\n\nIn other words you can forget about worrying what to :include to avoid the N+1 problem, the plugin will ensure that never happens\n\nWhen a find is done a record tracks the result set it was part of via its result_set variable (the result set may be something slightly immaterial, eg the one used to use some associations behind your back).\n\nA important consequence of all this is that most of the time (basically whenever you have a record that was loaded as part of a collection of more than one element (collection at the point of load from the database - if 10 records turn into 10 one element has_manys then that still counts as a collection of 10 elements)) you associations will be eager loaded. If there are any subtle differences between eager loading and \"normal\" loading you'll be finding about them soon. At the time of writing, has many :through is slightly different with regards to order and condition options. There is no way to not get associations eager loaded if you have a problematic one.\n\nYou can detach an element from it's result set with detach! This method is safe to call even if there is no result set. This will prevent associations on this method from being magically loaded (and prevent access to first level associations on this result set from trigger eager loads). This only applies one level down. Eg if we loaded an array of posts, triggered the load of the comments association on those post and then detached a post then the comments are all still part of the same result set (so detached_post.comments.author will load the author for all posts.)\n\nGotchas\n======\nThis has obvious garbage collection implications which have been completely ignored - if you hold on to a single non detached object you are holding to the entire result set.\n\nIf you are using Rails 2.1, then do not use in combination with has_one :through associations as a bug in preloading these associations will cause infinite recursion (fixed in http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b7a37b742c0abd1df8ea48cc82f76385cc0c41ea)\n\nSome types of associations produce unreliable results when eager loaded (eg has_many with limits) and so may produce undefined results. In the case of has_many with limits the plugin enforces this (ie lets the normal rails code run)\n\nCopyright (c) 2008 Frederick Cheung, released under the MIT

Dependencies\n\nDepends on validation_reflection plugin:\n\n  script/plugin install git://github.com/redinger/validation_reflection.git\n\n== Installation\n\nInstall the gem directly:\n\n  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)\n  sudo gem install pelargir-rspec_validation_expectations\n  \nOr install the gem in your Rails project:\n  \n  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com\n  script/plugin install pelargir-rspec_validation_expectations\n\nOr clone the project:\n\n  git clone git://github.com/pelargir/rspec_validation_expectations.git\n\n== Usage\n\nEnsure that validations and assocations are properly defined in your models:\n\n  describe User do\n    it_should_validate_presence_of     :first_name, :last_name, :email\n    it_should_validate_numericality_of :zip\n    it_should_validate_uniqueness_of   :email\n    it_should_validate_inclusion_of    :gender, :in => %w(Male Female)\n    \n    # tests that User.count increases by 1\n    it_should_be_createable :with => {:first_name => 'Ed', :last_name => 'The Duck', :email => 'a@b.com'}\n    \n    it_should_belong_to :employer\n    it_should_have_many :friends, :romans, :countrymen\n    it_should_have_one  :account\n    it_should_have_and_belong_to_many :comments\n  end\n  \nWhich gives you:\n\nruby script/spec --format s spec/models/user_spec.rb:\n\nUser\n- should validate presence of first name\n- should validate presence of last name\n- should validate presence of email\n- should validate numericality of zip\n- should validate uniqueness of email\n- should validate inclusion of gender as one of Male or Female\n- should be creatable\n- should belong to employer\n- should have many friends\n- should have many romans\n- should have many countrymen\n- should have one account\n- should have and belong to many comments\n\n== Resources\n\nRepository: http://github.com/pelargir/rspec_validation_expectations/\nBlog:

replacement for multi-user desktop systems","readme":"\t=======================================================\n\t submit â€” sendmail replacement for multi-user desktops\n\t=======================================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nsubmit is a daemon-less mail transfer agent for multi-user Unix systems.\nIn contrast to other MTAs, it moves the configuration of non-local mail\ndelivery away from system administrators and towards the individual\nusers.  Notable features are:\n\n * sendmail(8)-compatible command line interface.\n * Support for SMTP and Sendmail transports:  submit can relay mails\n   through smarthosts as well as interface with other sendmail programs\n   (such as those provided by Postfix, Exim or the original Sendmail).\n * Synchronous delivery:  When submit returns successfully, you can be\n   sure that your mail is out.\n * SSL/TLS support, including CA- and fingerprint-based validation\n   of the serverâ€™s identity and certificate-based authentication.\n * Pluggable interfaces (currently GTK+ and TTY) for authentication.\n * Optional daemon process storing SMTP passwords and passphrases to\n   private keys.\n * Optional support for different delivery methods depending on the\n   sender address selected in the mail client.\n\nMail user agents that work fine with submit include Mutt, Pine/Alpine,\nEvolution and KMail.  Sylpheed/Claws Mail and Thunderbird/Icedove have\nbeen determined not to be usable.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf your distribution provides submit packages, please use them.  They\nknow how to deal with overriding the default sendmail program shipped\nwith your mail transport agent.\n\nIf you have to manually install submit, please become root and type\n\n\t# python setup.py install\n\nto install the submit libraries as a site-local package for Python and\nthe submit binary to /usr/bin.  You can now either reconfigure your\nprograms to use /usr/bin/submit instead of /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail, or\nfigure out how your distribution handles custom replacements of files\nnormally shipped with stock packages.  See the submit manual, section\nâ€œInstallationâ€, for some pointers.\n\nWARNING: Never install submit as /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail!  This will\n\t inevitably lead to submit calling itself over and over when\n\t trying to deliver local mails.  Symlinking /usr/bin/submit to\n\t /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail is safe, though.\n\nBasic Configuration\n-------------------\n\nTo make submit deliver mails to SMTP relays, create a ~/.submit\ndirectory and place a file named â€œconfigâ€ in there:\n\n\t# ~/.submit/config example file\n\t[method remote]\n\ttype = smtp\n\thost = mail.example.com\t\t# replace this\n\tusername = your_user_name\t# replace this\n\tstarttls = on\t\t\t# use Transport Layer Security\n\nThis should do for many free mail providers.\n\nFurther Information\n-------------------\n\nFor details about submit, please refer to the submit user manual at\n<http://uiae.at/projects/submit/manual.html>.\n\nReport bugs to <submit@uiae.at>.\n\n -- Michael Schutte <michi@uiae.at>  Sun, 24 Aug 2008 12:47:28 +0200\n\nvim:tw=72:\n","language":[{"lang":"Python","bytes":71906}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"COPYING","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc","type":"Tree"},{"path":"doc/Makefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/manual.adc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"doc/submit.1.adc","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/submit","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/submit/__init__.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/auth.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/channel.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/config.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/daemon.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/deliverers","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/submit/deliverers/__init__.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/deliverers/sendmail.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/deliverers/smtp.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/deliverers/smtps.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/errors.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/frontend.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/i18n.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/message.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/ui","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/submit/ui/__init__.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/ui/gnome_ui.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/ui/gtk_ui.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/submit/ui/tty_ui.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"po","type":"Tree"},{"path":"po/LINGUAS","type":"Blob"},{"path":"po/Makefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"po/POTFILES.in","type":"Blob"},{"path":"po/de.po","type":"Blob"},{"path":"po/submit.pot","type":"Blob"},{"path":"setup.cfg","type":"Blob"},{"path":"setup.py","type":"Blob"},{"path":"submit","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"commiter":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"message":"Disable xmllint in the a2x call in doc/Makefile\n\nThis allows the submit.1 manual page to be built on systems where\ndocbookx.dtd is not available."},"author_login":"schutte","committer_login":"schutte"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"commiter":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"message":"Update the uiae.at URLs, dropping the /~michi/ path component"},"author_login":"schutte","committer_login":"schutte"},{"commit":{"author":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"commiter":{"name":"Michael Schutte","email":"michi@uiae.at"},"message":"Give GTK+ a chance to process destruction events without a mainloop\n\nSometimes dialog windows created by GTKInterface would remain on screen\nforever because the toolkit had no opportunity to actually handle the\ncalls to destroy().

You could upload the image to a database, or you could use upload_column for simple storage to the file system.\n\nAssuming you have a User model with a column called 'picture' that is of type String, you could simply add the upload_column instruction to your User model:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture\n    end\n\nThat's it! You can start uploading files. Of course, +upload_column+ has a lot of different options you can use to customize your uploads.\n\nUploading files is no fun without a user interface, so get going and make one:\n\nadd an upload_column_field to your form, maybe like this:\n\n    <p><label for=\"user_picture\">Picture</label><br/>\n    <%= upload_column_field 'user', 'picture'  %></p>\n\nYou should use upload_column_field instead of Rails' file_field, since it will work even when the form is redisplayed, like when a validation fails. Unfortunately file_field doesn't work in that case.\n\nNow that's excellent, but most likely it will fail, because instead of sending the file, it just sends a string. No worries though, if we just set the form's encoding to multipart it will all work out, UploadColumn even comes with some nice helpers to avoid that nasty multipart syntax. This could look something like this:\n\n    <%= upload_form_tag( :action => 'create' ) %>\n\nAnd that's it! Your uploads are up and running (hopefully) and you should now be able to add pictures to your users. The madness doesn't stop there of course!\n\n== Storage Path\n\nYou won't always want to store the pictures in the directory that upload_column selects for you, but that's not a problem, because changing that directory is trivial. You can pass a <tt>:store_dir</tt> key to the upload_column declaration, this will override the default mechanism and always use that directory as the basis.\n\n    upload_column :picture, :store_dir => \"pictures\"\n    \nmight be sensible in our case. Note that this way, all files will be stored in the same directory.\n\nIf you need more refined control over the storage path (maybe you need to store it by the id of an association?) then you can use a proc instead. Our proc might look like this:\n\n    upload_column :picture, :store_dir => proc{|record, file| \"images/#{record.category.name}/#{record.id}/#{file.extension}\"}\n\nThe proc will be passed two parameters, the first is the current instance of your model class, the second is the name of the attribute that is being uploaded to (in our case +attr+ would be <tt>:picture</tt>).\n\nYou can change the <tt>:tmp_dir</tt> in the same way.\n\n== Filename\n\nBy default, UploadColumn will keep the name of the original file, however this might be inconvenient in some cases. You can pass a :filename directive to your upload_column declaration:\n\n    upload_column :picture, :filename => \"donkey\"\n    \nIn which case all files will be named +donkey+. Usually it is more sensible to pass a Proc to :filename.\n\n    upload_column :picture, :filename => proc{|record, file| \"avatar#{record.id}\"}\n    \nThe Proc will be passed two parameters, the current instance, and the file itself. Don't specify the extension, it will be added automatically by type of uploaded file.\n\n== Manipulators\n\nUploadColumn allows you to use manipulators on your file, that in some way transform your file, or perform any kind\nof operations on it. There are currently two manipulators bundled, the RMagick manipulator and the ImageScience\nmanipulator, but writing your own is very easy. There are further instructions on the website.\n\n== Manipulating Images with RMagick\n\nSay you would want (for whatever reason) to have a funky solarize effect on your users' images. Manipulating images with upload_column can be done either at runtime or after the image is saved, let's look at some possibilities:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n      \n      def picture_after_assign\n        \n        picture.process! do |img|\n          img.solarize\n        end\n        \n      end\n    end\n\nYou can also use the :process instruction, which will automatically apply the manipulation when a new image is uploaded. If you wanted to resize your image to a maximum of 800 by 600 pixels for example, you could do:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :process => '800x600', :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n    \nthe previous example with solarize could be written shorter as:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :process => proc{|img| img.solarize }, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n\nOr maybe we want different versions of our image, then we could simply specify:\n \n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :versions => [ :solarized, :sepiatoned ], :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n      \n      def picture_after_assign\n        picture.solarized.process! do |img|\n          img.solarize\n        end\n        picture.sepiatoned.process! do |img|\n          img.sepiatone\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    \nyou can also use a Hash for versions and pass a dimension or a proc to it, so you can do:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture, :versions => { :thumb => \"c100x100\", :large => \"200x300\", :sepiatoned => proc{ |img| img.sepiatone } }, :manipulator => UploadColumn::Manipulators::RMagick\n    end\n    \nNote the 'c' in front of the dimensions for the thumb image, this will crop the image to the exact dimensions. All of this is a bit wordy though, and it also doesn't take check, that the files really are images. Sepiatoning the latest GreenDay song somehow doesn't sound too good. For that reason UploadColumn comes with the image_column function:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      image_column :picture, :versions => { :thumb => \"c100x100\", :large => \"200x300\", :sepiatoned => proc{ |img| img.sepiatone } }\n    end\n\nThis also puts your images in public/images instead of public, which is neat!\n\n== Runtime rendering\n\nYou can manipulate images at runtime (it's a huge performance hit though!). In your controller add an action and use UploadColumnRenderHelper.render_image.\n\n    def sepiatone\n      @user = User.find(parms[:id])\n      render_image @user.picture do |img|\n        img.sepiatone\n      end\n    end\n    \nAnd that's it!\n\nIn your view, you can use UploadColumnHelper.image to easily create an image tag for your action:\n\n    <%= image :action => \"sepiatone\", :id => 5 %>\n    \n== Views\n\nIf your uploaded file is an image you would most likely want to display it in your view, if it's another kind of file you'll want to link to it. Both of these are easy using UploadColumn::BaseUploadedFile.url.\n\n    <%= link_to \"Guitar Tablature\", @song.tab.url %>\n    \n    <%= image_tag @user.picture.url %>\n\n== Magic Columns\n\nUploadColumn allows you to add 'magic' columns to your model, which will be automatically filled with the appropriate data. Just add the column, for example via migrations:\n\n    add_column :users, :picture_content_type\n\nAnd if our model looks like this:\n\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      upload_column :picture\n    end\n\nThe column <tt>picture_content_type</tt> will now automatically be filled with the file's content-type (or at least with UploadColumn's best guess ;).\n\nYou can use any method method on UploadColumn::UploadedFile that takes no argument, so you can use for example, size, url, store_dir and so on.\n\nYou can also do <tt>picture_exif_date_time</tt> or <tt>picture_exif_model</tt>, etc. This works only, of course, if the uploaded file is a JPEG image, since that is the only filetype that has exif data. This requires the EXIFR library, which you can get by installing the gem via <tt>gem install exifr</tt>.\n      \n== Validations\n\nUploadColumn comes with its own validation method, validates_integrity_of. This method will ensure that only files with an extension from a whitelist will be uploaded. This prevents a hacker from uploading executable files (such as .rb, .pl or .cgi for example) or it can be used to restrict what kind of file are allowed to be uploaded, for example only images. You can customize the whitelist with the :extensions parameter to upload column.\n\nIf you want to only allow the upload of XHTML and XML files, so you can manipulate them with XSLT you could do:\n\n    upload_column :xml, :extensions => %w(xml html htm), :manipulator => MyXSLTProcessor\n\n\tvalidate_integrity_of :xml\n\nYou can also use some of Rails' validations with UploadColumn.\n\nvalidates_presence_of and validates_size_of have been verified to work. \n\n    validates_size_of :image, :maximum => 200000, :message => \"is too big, must be smaller than 200kB!\"\n\nRemember to change the error message, the default one sounds a bit stupid with UploadColumn.\n\nvalidates_uniqueness_of does NOT work, this is because validates_uniqueness_of will send(:your_upload_column) instead of asking for the instance variable, thus it will get an UploadedFile object, which it can't really compare to other values in the database, this is rather difficult to work around without messing with Rails internals (if you manage, please let me know!). Meanwhile you could do\n\n    validates_each :your_upload_column do |record, attr, value|    \n      record.errors.add attr, 'already exists!' if YourModel.find( :first, :conditions => [\"#{attr.to_s} = ?\", value ] )\n    end\n\nIt's not elegant I know, but it should work.\n","language":[{"lang":"Ruby","bytes":143753}],"repository":[{"path":".gitignore","type":"Blob"},{"path":"CHANGELOG","type":"Blob"},{"path":"LICENSE","type":"Blob"},{"path":"README","type":"Blob"},{"path":"Rakefile","type":"Blob"},{"path":"init.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/upload_column.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/active_record_extension.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/configuration.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/magic_columns.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/manipulators","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/manipulators/image_science.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/manipulators/rmagick.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/rails","type":"Tree"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/rails/action_controller_extension.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/rails/asset_tag_extension.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/rails/upload_column_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/sanitized_file.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"lib/upload_column/uploaded_file.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/active_record_extension_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/custom_matchers.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures","type":"Tree"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/animated.gif","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/animated_solarized.gif","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/invalid-image.jpg","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/kerb.jpg","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/kerb_solarized.jpg","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/netscape.gif","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/fixtures/skanthak.png","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/image_science_manipulator_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/integration_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/magic_columns_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/rmagick_manipulator_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/sanitized_file_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/spec_helper.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/upload_column_spec.rb","type":"Blob"},{"path":"spec/uploaded_file_spec.rb","type":"Blob"}],"truncated":false,"commits":[{"commit":{"author":{"name":"noname2","email":"nn@rtfm.cz"},"commiter":{"name":"noname2","email":"nn@rtfm.cz"},"message":"allow
